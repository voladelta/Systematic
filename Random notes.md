fake till you make it bill gate
Microsoft’s march to a $1.54tr market value started with the company selling a product it had not, in fact, built. Bill Gates and Paul Allen contacted computer manufacturer MITS to sell them a BASIC interpreter. They scheduled a demo, and built their interpreter. Or rather, first they built an emulator for the Altair (which they didn’t have) to run on Harvard’s computers (which they didn’t have permission to use) in order to write their interpreter (which Allen finished on the flight to the meeting). Subsequent success turned that from a lie to an endearing exaggeration, although Microsoft’s later successes gave the story a sinister cast once again.

The Category Copywriting Playbook
All great copywriting involves the same 3 steps:
1.    Make a list of "conventional wisdom" in your industry. What do most people think is right/true - related to the topic you're writing about.
2.    Educate them on why that's wrong. Take the conventional wisdom and say the opposite. For example, most writers think the best way to start writing online is to start a blog. "I think that's false."
3.    Tell them how to do the opposite. What should they do instead? And what are the benefits of doing this opposed to following conventional wisdom?


The economy is just smart people paying beautiful people to promote stuff to insecure people.


People don’t want to buy information
They’re buying a desired outcome
That’s why you should give information away for free
And sell products (and services) that enable outcomes

People don’t buy products.
They buy better versions of themselves.

- The outcome you want isn't far away.
- This small action will lead to a giant outcome.
- This massive problem can be fixed with this simple solution.


How to create an Irresistible Ghostwriting Offer:

• Anchor to TIME ("This will take you X hours on your own—or hire me.")
• Anchor to COST ("This will cost you $ X on your own—or hire me.")
• Anchor to EFFORT ("This will be X difficult—or hire me.")

No-brainer trade.


Nothing is as desired as much as the thing you want but can’t have.
The hierarchy of wants that goes something like this:
- If you don’t want something and don’t have it, you don’t think about it.
- If you want something and have it, you might feel OK.
- If you want something and don’t have it, you might feel motivated.
- If you want something and can’t have it, you drive yourself mad.


All makes sense when you understand what your brain wants.
It doesn’t want nice cars or big homes.
It wants dopamine.

That’s it. Your brain just wants dopamine.

The Molecule of More to describe the process:
- Dopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for more – more stuff, more stimulation, and more surprises.
- In pursuit of these things, it is undeterred by emotion, fear, or morality.
- From dopamine’s point of view, it’s not the having that matters; it’s getting something – anything – that’s new.
- Your brain doesn’t want stuff. It doesn’t even want new stuff. It wants to engage in the process and anticipation of getting new stuff.


Models are people or things that show us what is worth wanting. It is models – not our “objective” analysis or central nervous system – that shape our desires.


All of our desires come from other people who served as models to shape what we want. Often, these people endow these desires in us by showing them that they want these things. People often don’t think about models that have influenced them or how they have served as models.

They think the world works like this: 
Person → Desire → Object

But it actually works like this: 
Person → Desire → Model → Object


All accusation is confession


Pay attention = Choose what to ignore


What you believe to be true is influenced by how much you want it to be true. 
The more something helps you deal with uncertainty, the lower the bar is for you to believe it’s true.

In chemistry or life, specific conditions are often required for a reaction to occur.


HOW TO GET NEW IDEAS
The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life, (much of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge.
Knowledge grows fractally. From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds.


It's always a good question to put to a new client: we all know what you make - but are you as certain what your customers are buying?
Simple as it sounds, it's a constructively difficult question to answer.
You make expensive pens; but that's not what people are buying.
What people are buying will be prestige, or personal pleasure, or the hope of gratitude from a recipient.
You make multi-coloured chocolate buttons; but that's not what people are buying. What people are buying is a moment's welcome peace from demanding children.
You make laptop PCs; but that's not what people are buying.
What people are buying will be self-sufficiency, self-esteem, efficiency and mobility.
As Theodore Levitt pointed out many years ago: people don't want a quarter-inch drill; they want a quarter-inch hole. And for every product or service, there's an equivalent distinction to be made - though seldom so easily or so elegantly.


Sales tips.
1. Sales is a lot like golf. You can make it so complicated as to be impossible or you can simply walk up and hit the ball. I've been leading and building sales orgs for almost 20 years and my advice is to walk up and hit the ball.
2. Sales is about people and it's about problem solving. It is not about solutions or technology or chemicals or lines of code or artichokes. It's about people and it's about solving problems.
3. People buy 4 things and 4 things only. Ever. Those 4 things are time, money, sex, and approval/peace of mind. If you try selling something other than those 4 things you will fail.
4. People buy aspirin always. They buy vitamins only occasionally and at unpredictable times. Sell aspirin.
5. I say in every talk I give: "all things being equal people buy from their friends. So make everything else equal then go make a lot of friends."
6. Being valuable and useful is all you ever need to do to sell things. Help people out. Send interesting posts.
Write birthday cards. Record videos sharing your ideas for growing their business. Introduce people who would benefit from knowing each other then get out of the way, expecting nothing in return. Do this consistently and authentically and people will find ways to give you money. I promise.
7. No one cares about your quota, your payroll, your opex, your burn rate, etc. No one. They care about the problem you are solving for them.


If youre holding a center puzzle piece in your hand and staring at an empty tabletop, it's difficult to determine where to place it. If all of the puzzle is complete except for that one piece, then you know exactly where it goes. The same is generally true of art. The more of the work you can see, the easier it becomes to gracefully place the final details clearly where they belong.

"I want to think about things where I have an advantage over others. I don't want to play a game where people have an advantage over me. I don't play in a game where other people are wise and I am stupid. I look for a game where I am wise, and they are stupid. And believe me, it works better. God bless our stupid competitors. They make us rich."
— Charlie Munger


One key memory finding is people forget abstract points & remember the concrete & visualizable

Steve Jobs was a master at this

When launching Macbook Air in 2008 he didn't just say it was 2cm thick, he said (& then demonstrated) that it fit in a manilla envelope


These points emphasize that some human behaviors are so deeply ingrained that they transcend time and place, suggesting that understanding these behaviors can offer valuable insights into both the past and the future.

* Greed and Fear: People have always been, and continue to be, influenced by greed and fear. These emotions drive many decisions and actions throughout history, and they remain strong factors in how people behave today[1].
* Influence of Risk and Jealousy: The way people are motivated by risk and affected by feelings of jealousy is consistent over time. These emotions can lead to familiar patterns of behavior, impacting relationships, business decisions, and more.
* Tribal Affiliations: The strong influence of tribal affiliations on behavior is a consistent thread in human history. The need to belong to a group, and the behaviors driven by this need, are deeply rooted and recognizably similar across different ages and cultures.
* Overconfidence and Shortsightedness: Human beings often display overconfidence and shortsightedness, ignoring long-term consequences for immediate gains. This has been a recurring trend that can lead to personal and societal challenges.
* Search for Happiness and Certainty: People have always sought the secret to a happy life and strived for certainty, even when it is clear that complete certainty cannot be achieved. This quest is deeply human and relatable across different times and cultures.
