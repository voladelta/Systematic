## What Causes Behavior Change

The Fogg Behavior Model shows that three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: **Motivation**, **Ability**, and a **Prompt**. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing.

## Motivation
Three Core Motivators, Each of these has two sides
- Sensation: pleasure/pain
- Anticipation: hope/fear
- Belonging: acceptance/rejection

## Ability
In order to perform a target behavior, a person must have the ability to do so. That seems obvious, of course. But designers of products and services often assume people have more ability than they really do.

There are three paths to increasing ability.

You can train people, giving them more skills, more ability to do the target behavior. That’s the hard path. Don’t take this route unless you really must. Training people is hard work, and most people resist learning new things. That’s just how we are as humans: lazy.

Another option is to give someone a tool or resource that makes the behavior easier to do. For example, a cookbook makes cooking at home easier to do. 

Another option is to scale back the target behavior so it is easier to do. 

## Prompts
Without a Prompt, the target behavior will not happen. Sometimes a Prompt can be external, like an alarm sounding. Other times, the Prompt can come from our daily routine: Walking through the kitchen may trigger us to open the fridge. 

The concept of Prompt has different names: cue, trigger, call to action, request, and so on. 

Three Types of Prompts: Facilitator, Signal, and Spark. Those designing to influence behavior should use the Prompt type that matches their target user’s context, which combines Motivation and Ability. 

## Tiny Habits
Three things can lead to lasting change:
1. Have an epiphany.
2. Change your environment.
3. Change your habits in tiny ways.

The essence of Tiny Habits:
> Take a behavior you want, make it tiny, find where it fits naturally in your life, and nurture its growth. If you want to create long-term change, it’s best to start small.”

Why tiny is so powerful:
1. Tiny is fast.
2. Tiny is safe.
3. Tiny can start now.
4. Tiny can grow big.
5. Tiny is transformative.
6. Tiny reduces dependence on willpower and motivation.

The anatomy of a tiny habit:
1. Anchor Moment. An existing routine (like brushing your teeth) or an event that happens (like a phone ringing). The Anchor Moment reminds you to do the new Tiny Behavior.
2. New Tiny Behavior. A simple version of the new habit you want, such as flossing one tooth or doing two push-ups. You do the Tiny Behavior immediately after the Anchor Moment.
3. Instant Celebration. Something you do to create positive emotions, such as saying, “I did a good job!” You celebrate immediately after doing the new Tiny Behavior.

When troubleshooting a behavior use the following steps:
1. See if there’s prompt to do the behavior.
2. See if the person has the ability to do the behavior.
3. See if the person is motivated to do the behavior.

### Motivation—Focus on Matching
Motivation is unreliable. You cannot depend on motivation alone (or even as the primary driver) for behavior change.

The three sources of motivation:
1. Person: Yourself (e.g. what you want)
2. Action: External benefit or punishment
3. Context (e.g. all your friends are doing it)

Motivation Wave: Idea in Behavior Design in which surges in motivation can result in difficult tasks being accomplished. However, Motivation Waves are not sustainable over the long term (best for initiation or one-time behaviors).

Motivation Fluctuation: Motivational changes on a day-to-day basis. Examples: Willpower decreasing from morning too evening. Complex decisions are harder at night. Focus and concentration are fleeting on Friday afternoon/evening.

> Motivating toward and abstraction doesn’t yield results.

Specificity is critical if you want results. Aspiration towards a vague goal is nice but not effective. Examples: “I want to be healthier.” “I want to feel fulfilled.”

> Motivation is not the winning ticket for long-term change.

You should have big dreams, moonshots, vision boards BUT you should have a vivid idea or picture of what you want and work to figure out how to get there.
> Aspirations are abstract desires, like wanting your kids to succeed in school. Outcomes are measurable, like getting straight A’s…But aspirations and outcomes are not behaviors.

> People use the word ‘goal’ when they are talking about aspirations or outcomes. If someone says ‘goal,’ you can’t be sure what they are talking about since the word is ambiguous. For that reason, ‘goal’ is not part of the vocabulary in Behavior Design. Use either ‘aspiration’ or ‘outcome’ for precision.

Magic Wanding: Method in which the individual specifies an aspiration or outcome (e.g. “Reduce my stress”) and then brainstorms the various behaviors to get to that state (this will yield a “Swarm of Behaviors”). Examples might include: Moving to Maui, getting a dog, getting a pay raise, walking every day, meditating, etc.

Use the following categories during your Magic Wanding sessions:
1. What behaviors would you do one time?
2. What new habits would you create?
3. What habit would you stop?

Many different behaviors (and combinations of behaviors) can lead to an aspiration.

Behavior Matching: Identifying the optimal behaviors from your Magic Wanding session and implementing it. You want to match yourself with a specific behavior. The best matches are called “Golden Behaviors.”

Characteristics of Golden Behaviors:
– The behavior is effective in realizing your aspiration (impact).– You want to do the behavior (motivation).– You can do the behavior (ability).

Focus Mapping: A technique that uses a four-quadrant diagram to identify Golden Behaviors from your Swarm of Behaviors.

 ### Ability—Easy Does It
Fogg discusses simplicity as a strategic advantage for Instagram’s domination of the photo-sharing space. The key insight is that, when viewed through the lease of the Behavior Model, simplicity is directed towards the goal of maximizing A (Ability) in the equation B=MAP. Instagram made sharing photos “easy as pie” with a mere 3-click process (and removed all other features from their original app, Brbn, that got in the way of this end goal). As a result, the B (Behavior) was encouraged since the users were given easy ability to share.

> Instagram’s competitors had features that people wanted, but none of them cracked the code on photo sharing.

> “Most people operate under the assumption that they’ve got to go big or go home.” This fails most of the time. Tiny and consistent will yield higher success rate.

> “Burst and bust” cycle is when you have intermittent periods of high motivation and productivity (burst) followed by fallow periods of inactivity (bust). Tiny habits attempts to circumvent this cycle.

Starting tiny is one way to mitigate the unpredictability of motivation. Tiny improves the “A” in the equation B=MAP. Example: Starting off with 100 pushups is hard. Starting with single pushups is easier.

> “When you are designing a new habit, you are really designing for consistency. And for that result, you’ll find that simplicity is the key.”

> “Simplicity changes behavior.”

Ability is the most reliable variable in the B=MAP model.

Remember: Behaviors become easier to do when repeated.

Engaging in positive behaviors also results in improved confidence and motivation.

Start with this question when looking at the Ability variable for a given behavior: “What is making this behavior hard to do?”
1. Is there enough time to do the behavior?
2. Is there enough money to do the behavior?
3. Am I physically capable of doing the behavior?
4. Does the behavior require a lot of creative or mental energy?
5. Does the behavior fit into my routine or do I need to adjust my schedule or routine?

Fogg calls these the “Ability Factors:” Time, money, physical effort, mental effort, routine. The weakest factor in this “chain” is a potential weak-link that will need to be addressed/fixed.

Identify the weak links in your Ability Chain to determine which problem to solve.

Second question to ask when you want to encourage a behavior: ”How can I make this behavior easier to do?”

Three ways to make behaviors easier:
1. Increase your skills.
2. Get tools and resources.
3. Make the behavior tiny.

How to make things “tiny”:
1. “Starter Step”: This is a very small move toward the desired behavior. If you want to walk 3 miles, a Starter Step might be putting your shoes on. For reading a book it might be the act of opening the book.
2. “Scaling Back”: Take a behavior you want and shrink it. For instance, the author wanted to floss all his teeth. He scaled this objective back by aiming to floss a single tooth. Instead of reading a book, plan to read one page.

### Prompts—The Power of After
> “No behavior happens without a prompt.”

Life is filled with a combination of unwanted and unsolicited prompts as well as intentional, planned prompts.

Most people operate on autopilot and are easily influenced by the myriad of invisible prompts both online and offline.

Don’t leave prompts to chance. Design the prompts for the behaviors you want.

“For some habits, it’s all about finding out where a new habit fits into your day.”

Three types of prompts in our lives:
1. Person prompts
2. Context prompts
3. Action prompts

The Person Prompt: This prompt relies on internal signals to trigger a behavior. For instance, bodily urges and functions are kinds of Person Prompts (example: grumbling stomach).

The Context Prompt: Things in your environment that trigger action. Examples include: sticky notes, app notifications, a ringing phone, a verbal reminder from a friend, an email or text to yourself. A calendar entry with an automated alert is a kind of context prompt.

Management of your prompt landscape can be challenging. Too many context prompts can create cognitive overload.

Removal and deletion of unneeded prompts is an important part of managing your prompt landscape. Examples: Removing yourself from an email list, disabling app notifications, putting your phone on “do not disturb mode, being more judicious about what gets included on your to-do list.

Offline prompts have been around for a long time but online prompts are newer and therefore harder for us to deal with (as we are all still figuring out how to digest information in the Information Age).

Action Prompts: A behavior you already do that can be used as a trigger for a new habit. Example: You already brush your teeth so you bundle a new habit (flossing) with it. Note: some people describe this as “habit stacking”.

Fogg likes to call Action Prompts “anchors” because the existing habit is already stable and solid. An Action Prompt is tied to something already reliable.

Behaviors often happen as sequences of actions. You can “hack” the sequence by coding a new tiny habit into the existing sequence.

The Action Prompt “formula:” After I do [anchor habit], I will do [new habit].

Consider the following when matching a new habit with an appropriate anchor:
1. Match the physical location (you want compatible actions for a given environment).
2. Match the frequency (e.g. if you want a new habit to occur frequently you need to pair it with an anchor that is similarly frequent).
3. Match the theme/purpose

This recipe will likely fail: “After I brush my teeth, I will sweep the garage.” The reason is that location, frequency and purpose are poorly matched.

This recipe will likely succeed: “After I drink water, I will water my plant.” The purpose/theme is linked. You drink, the plant drinks.

If your Action Prompt isn’t working experiment with it by making the anchor more specific (Fogg calls this a trailing edge anchor). For instance. Instead of anchoring to the activity of “brushing my teeth” use an even more specific endpoint: “put my toothbrush back into the charger.”

### Emotions Create Habits
Learn to recognize your successes and feel good about what you’ve accomplished.

Celebration is an important way to reinforce good behaviors and encourage new behaviors.

Celebration will put you in a positive and abundance oriented mindset. This will position you well for continue progress and more positive behaviors.

> “Positive experiences reinforce positive habits.”

> “There is a direct connection between what you feel when you do a behavior and the likelihood that you will repeat the behavior in the future.”

Too many people rely on the myth that repetition and frequency creates habits.

> “Emotions create habits.”

The Spectrum of Automaticity: A simple model that explains the difference between decisions and habits. Decisions are not automatic (one end of spectrum). Strong habits are fully automatic (other end of the spectrum). Distinction is not binary. Some behaviors may be mostly automated but require a small bit of deliberate input.

Differentiate between incentives and rewards. “A reward in behavior science is an experience directly tied to a behavior that makes that behavior more likely to happen again. The timing of the reward matters…rewards need to happen either during the behavior or milliseconds afterward.” Incentives are not as strongly bound to the behavior (example: sales bonus or a massage at the end of the month for meeting a goal).

Note that celebrations are only needed to establish a habit. You can omit this step once the habit becomes automatic.

Celebrations should be immediate (per Fogg’s definition of a reward). A celebration can be as simple as a fist-pump or a smile.

“Shine” is the term Fogg uses for the immediate feeling of success upon completing a positive behavior.
