> Products are bought, not sold.

Instead of pushing your idea on the buyer, it’s a better move to guide them to discover it on their own, so they believe it, trust it, and get excited about it. Then they’ll want to buy it and will feel good about the chance to work with you.

You’ll start by getting your audience — whether they’re a buyer, an investor, or a business partner — to pay full attention to you and take you seriously, as they would a partner or colleague. And you’ll do this by achieving **Status Alignment**, the first step to making a deal.

No buyer of any kind is going to listen to you until they feel they’re in the right place at the right time with the right person. That’s why the **Status Tip-Off** is so powerful. When your buyer sees that you understand who they are, can speak their language, and are part of their in-group, they’ll immediately become receptive to what you have to say. Whether you’re talking to an assembly line worker or the CEO of the company, you need to establish that you fit right into their world.

Either way, a Status Tip-Off works the same—it’s a brief story or phrase that would be known only by an in-group member and will instantly cement your status as “one of us.”

Three key elements that make up a successful Tip-Off: 
- Use Specific Industry Lingo
- Describe a Recent Action You Have Taken
- Mention a Real Situation Everyone in the Industry Cares About

But achieving Status Alignment is not enough to make a deal happen. You probably have friends whom you trust and respect. However, how many of them would you hire to manage and invest your money?

When the stakes are high, you need to instill absolute Certainty in the buyer’s mind that you’re a true expert in your field and that things will happen exactly as you say they will. To do this, you’re going to use a **Flash Roll**.

The Flash Roll
- should 60s to 90s to deliver—that’s about 250 words. 
- must locate a problem; it should take a point of view and it should arrive at a deductive conclusion about how to solve a problem. 
- with a clear beginning, middle, and end. 
- told dispassionately, with no emotional content or display. It must be completely stripped of all editorial, emotional, and extraneous details; it is literally just a list of technical actions that can be taken to solve a very difficult problem. Without ego or pride or even charisma, it should explain exactly what you did to solve a specific problem and then what the outcome was. 
- use dense, technical jargon that most people will tell you to avoid using. 

To write your Flash Roll, describe the problem being faced, your assessment of it, your proposed solution, and the economics (how long it would take and what the results would be, or were the last time you did it). Freely use technical terms, writing exactly the way you talk to the technical people in your business when you’re one-on-one with them. 

The manner in which you deliver the Flash Roll is of the utmost importance. You absolutely cannot be seeking validation or opinion of the buyer. You are the expert, not he. This Flash Roll assessment shouldn’t come across as something you are proud of. Instead, it should seem like it’s mundane and uninteresting to you—not a big deal at all; like if I asked you about it in a few hours you might forget you even said it. To end the Flash Roll, you can just shrug and say something like, “Anyway, based on what I’m seeing here, that’s what I would do.” Then leave it all behind and move on to the next part of the presentation.

Once you’ve established your Status and expertise, it’s time to explain your big idea to the buyer. Specifically, to answer the three questions in the buyer’s mind: **Why should I care? What’s in it for me? and Why you?** The faster you answer these, and the less cognitive strain you place on the buyer, the better your chances are of closing the deal. The easiest way to do this is using a sequence of Pre-Wired Ideas:
- Winter Is Coming
- 2X
- Skin in the Game

These ideas are designed to fit into the deepest pre-wired idea receptors in the human brain while supplying your audience with the answers they need to move forward with you. With Pre-Wired Ideas, your audience will understand everything they need to know about you and what you’re offering.

But you don’t just want your buyer to understand your idea, you want them to buy in and pitch it back to you—to invite you into your own deal. You want to flip the script. And this isn’t going to happen until the buyer feels safe to explore your idea more deeply and entertain both the positives and the potential negatives.

To make the buyer feel interested enough to explore a new idea but safe enough to move forward, you need to find their novelty sweet spot. [[MAYA]]. Show them how your offer is the **New Normal**—a **Plain Vanilla** concept with just one key and valuable difference. To keep things moving along, you should lump together all of the ways your product or idea is new and unique so the buyer isn’t overwhelmed or scared to buy it. Then show how your offer is new and different from the status quo in just one key way. If you’re in a room full of Czech business executives as I was, you can tell them you’re exactly the same as the top ten creative agencies in the world, but much smaller (and therefore more effective).

By this point, the buyer is becoming attracted to your idea and the idea of working with you, and you won’t feel the need to control, pressure, or corner them. Instead, you’ll be in free exchange of ideas and plans to move forward.

However, before you actually turn the power to make the decision over to your buyer, there’s one final step: You need to contain their pessimism within a set of pre-defined boundaries. I call this an invisible fence. To do this, use a **Buyer’s Formula** to teach them how to buy whatever you’re selling.

When you list the obvious ways to fail before you relinquish control to the buyer, you block off certain options in their mind, like when you tell a late-career athlete about the common mistakes made by other big name late-career athletes or when you tell a car company about the obvious mistakes in hiring a car advertising firm that can cost millions. That’s why it’s so important to build Alignment and Certainty, so you are credible, believable, and in position as the world’s best expert in the buyer’s specific problem.

While almost nothing works on everyone, you’ll be surprised how effective this can be to get someone’s attention: **arousing their curiosity by threatening their social ranking and then offering a valuable secret**. When these elements are combined, no one can resist at least taking a look. It’s as close to a universal curiosity formula as you can get.

1. Introduce the Buyer’s Formula. To start, I’ll say something like, “I deal with this kind of thing all the time. Let me try and help.”
2. Outline Obvious Ways to Fail. Create boundaries that your buyer will not venture outside of, by highlighting the obvious ways to fail.
3. Highlight Counterintuitive Ways to Fail. These are traps that most people fall into, things that your buyer surely believes he already knows, but really he doesn’t. You are going to expertly point a few of these out and teach your buyer at least one valuable insight.
4. List Obvious Actions. Tell your buyer what actions he should take to get started. Again, start with a few no-brainers, or things your buyer already knows in the back of his mind and will definitely agree with.
5. Less Obvious “Hacks”. These are the things you would only figure out by doing it at least 100 times.
6. Hand Over Autonomy. Hand over autonomy with a shrug and a line that detaches you from the outcome, like, “Yeah, well, that’s just what I’d do, having done it at least a hundred times already. I’m not the boss of you. You can do whatever you want.”
7. Redirect to Keep the Buyer “In Bounds”. From time to time the buyer will venture outside the boundaries you have set and ask about something that you already said was a rookie mistake in your Buyer’s Formula. 

If the buyer won’t respect your expert status and your Buyer’s Formula, he’s never going to be a good customer, partner, or investor. Start backing away from him. But once your buyer has the Buyer’s Formula and does accept your expert status, you have laid an invisible fence. Now you can safely step back and provide autonomy.

*One note of caution*: Through the above five steps, you can’t change who you are or change your values to make the buyer happy. One reason why so many people are mistrustful of salespeople is because they see the seller move through different characters during a sales pitch, and this leaves buyers feeling confused and uncertain. Flipping the script isn’t about changing yourself to give the buyer what they want; it’s about sticking to your guns. **Stay consistent to your personality, your character, and most importantly, your values**. This is what the most compelling people in the world have that others don’t: character and values.

In the final delivery of your ideas, if you’re considered an insider and an expert, if the buyer knows why they should care about your idea, what’s in it for them, and why you; if you acknowledge their concerns or objections, and guide them through the process of buying your product; and in all this they find you to be a compelling person, they will search for, find, and suggest a way to do business with you.
