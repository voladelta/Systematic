Tackling problems involves 3 activities that you cycle through repeatedly:

1. **Framing (and subsequently reframing) the problem**: when you determine what to focus on?
2. **Analyzing the problem**: when you study the chosen framing of the problem in depth, trying to quantify it and understand the finer details
3. **Solving the problem**: the actual steps you take to fix it; things like experimentation, prototyping, and eventually implementing the full solution

There are 2 different ways to look for new angles on a problem:

1. **Exploring the frame**: when you try to reframe a problem by delving deeper into the details of the first framing
2. **Breaking the frame**: when you step away from the first framing, putting an entirely different spin on it

# frame the problem

Before you can reframe a problem, you first have to frame it, giving you something to work on. To do so:

- Ask, “What problem are we trying to solve?” This triggers the reframing process. You might also ask “Are we solving the right problem?” or “Let’s revisit the problem for a second.”
- If possible, quickly write a problem statement, describing the problem in a few sentences. Keep it short, and use full sentences.
- Next to the statement, list the main stakeholders: Who is involved in the problem?

Once you have the first framing, subject it to a quick review. Look for the following in particular:

- Is the statement true? Is the elevator actually slow? Compared to what? How do we know this?
- Are there self-imposed limitations? At TV2, the team asked “Where can we find money?” instead of assuming it had to come out of their own budget.
- Is a solution “baked into” the problem framing? Often, problems are framed so that they point to a specific answer. This is not necessarily bad, but it’s important to notice.
- Is the problem clear? Problems don’t always present as problems. Often, you are really looking at a goal or a pain point in disguise.
- With whom is the problem located? Words like we, me, and they suggest who may “own” the problem. Who is not mentioned or implicated?
- Are there strong emotions? Emotional words typically indicate areas you should explore in more depth.
- Are there false trade-offs? Who defined the choices you are presented with? Can you create a better alternative than the ones presented?

# look outside the frame

For each problem, remember to look outside the frame:

- Don’t get caught up in the visible details.
- Think about what might be missing from your current framing of the problem.

Once you have done a general review, try to apply the four tactics described in the chapter, summarized here.

### 1. LOOK BEYOND YOUR OWN EXPERTISE

Remember the law of the hammer: we tend to frame problems so that they match our preferred solutions. In Brazil, the finance people focused on the financial metrics of the stock price, overlooking the communications aspect.

Consider the following:

- What is your own favorite “hammer,” meaning the type of solution you are good at applying?
- What type of problem does your hammer match?
- What if the problem was not such a problem: What else could it be?

### 2. LOOK TO PRIOR EVENTS

Recall the shouting match with the teacher in which a prior event may have caused the issue: “Did you eat breakfast this morning?”. Consider:

- How are you framing the problem from a time perspective?
- Did something important happen before the period of time you are looking at?
- For that matter, is there something after the time period that you missed? For instance, do people act a certain way because they fear a future outcome?

### 3. LOOK FOR HIDDEN INFLUENCES

Remember the marshmallow test and how the researchers overlooked the influence of poverty. Or think about how Pierre figured out the influence his bank’s office building had on recruiting. Consider:

- Are there stakeholders whose influence you’re missing?
- Are there higher-level, systemic factors at play that influence the people involved?

### 4. LOOK FOR NONOBVIOUS ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION

Remember the light bulb problem, in which a less salient quality—that light bulbs emit heat—led to a more efficient solution than the one most people come up with.

- Are there non-obvious aspects of the problem or the situation that you could look into?
- Do you have data that can help you, or other things that are already available to us?
- How is functional fixedness affecting you?

Finally, are there other things “outside the frame” that you are not paying attention to? Incentives? Emotions? People or groups you have forgotten about? Briefly consider this, and then move on.

# rethink the goal

Review your problem statements.

- Start by writing down the goal: What would success look like? What is the goal (or goals) I am trying to achieve?
- Then draw a goal map (like the promotion example) to clarify the higher-level goals.
- If you like, you can also map the sub-goals at the same time. What steps are necessary or helpful to achieve your goal?

If you need more guidance in drawing the map, try to apply these questions to each listed goal in the map, based on Min Basadur’s work:

- Surface higher-level goals by asking, Why do we want to achieve this goal? What is the benefit? What is the goal behind the goal?
- Surface sub-goals by asking, What is stopping us from reaching this goal?
- Look for other goals as well by asking, What else is important?

Once you have drawn the map, do a quick review to see if any of the goals are defined too narrowly. (Remember the example of “I need a higher salary” versus “I need X dollars in five years.”) Ask, Are there any simple self-imposed limitations? Make sure the framing of the goals doesn’t imply a specific solution unless it’s genuinely necessary.

### CHALLENGE THE LOGIC

Recall how the finance teams weren’t necessarily right about the benefits of Net-90 terms. Ask:

- Are our assumptions actually true? Does the immediate goal necessarily lead to the outcome we ultimately want?
- Even if it’s generally true, are there special circumstances where it doesn’t apply? Do we need to refine or revise our thinking about how we win?

### ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO ACHIEVE THE IMPORTANT GOALS?

Remember Robert Sternberg’s story of the executive who used the headhunter to get his boss a different job instead of himself. Recall as well Lori Weise’s story: Instead of getting more shelter dogs adopted, can we help their families so that their dogs never enter the shelter system in the first place?

In a similar manner, ask:

- Are there better goals to pursue?
- Are there alternative ways of achieving the higher-level goal?

### QUESTION OBVIOUS GOALS, TOO

Are there any goals that sound so obviously good that they should not be questioned? Question them anyway—and be wary of words with positive connotations, such as authenticity, originality, and safety.

### EXAMINE THE SUBGOALS AS WELL

If you haven’t already, map the sub-goals, and then subject them to the same scrutiny. What might you be wrong about? What might you be forgetting?

# examine bright spots

Revisit your own problem statements. For each problem, consider if there are any bright spots.

### HAVE YOU ALREADY SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LEAST ONCE?

People often struggle with problems they have already solved. Via their painless discussion over breakfast, Tania and Brian Luna realized that their fights were caused in part by their timing. With that in mind, consider if there was ever a time—even just once:

- When you didn’t have the problem
- When the problem was less severe
Or when the problem happened, yet the usual negative impact didn’t occur

Is there anything you can learn from these bright spots? If not, can you potentially recreate the behaviors or circumstances that led to the bright spot—basically, doing more of what works?

### ARE THERE POSITIVE OUTLIERS IN OUR GROUP?

Recall the story of the illiterate parents in Argentina’s Misiones district: by studying three “outlier” schools, the schools found a better way to frame the problem of parental involvement.

- Is there anyone in your peer group that has solved the problem? Can you find out what they’re doing differently?

### WHO ELSE DEALS WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM?

To find bright spots in other industries, remember Martin Reeves’s point about describing the problem in more abstract terms and how that helped the pfizerWorks team find a bright spot in the hotel industry. In the same way:

- How could you describe your problem in more abstract terms?
- Who else, outside your own industry, deals with that type of problem?
- Who seems not to have this problem, even if they are in a similar situation? What are they doing differently?

### CAN WE BROADCAST THE PROBLEM WIDELY?

Recall the DSM case and how the company found a solution by broadcasting its problem via a simple slide deck. If you can’t identify someone who has solved the problem, could you do something similar?

# look in the mirror

Revisit your own problem statements. For each problem, do the following:

### EXPLORE YOUR OWN CONTRIBUTION

Recall the idea of focusing on contribution rather than blame that Sheila Heen and her co-authors talk about. Problems can be the result of multiple people’s actions, including yours.

- Ask yourself: What is my part in creating this problem?
- Even if you don’t contribute to the problem, ask whether you can react differently to it (recall how seven-year-old Isabella did this with her younger sister).

### SCALE THE PROBLEM DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL

Problems can exist on many levels at once. Corruption, for instance, exists at a personal level, an organizational level, and a societal level. Not all problems are caused by your actions or at your level—but that doesn’t mean that a problem can’t be addressed at your level, at least in part. For problems that seem too big to solve, ask: Is there a way to frame the problem that makes it actionable at my level?

### GET AN OUTSIDE VIEW OF YOURSELF

Remember the concept of external self-awareness: How do you come across to other people? To map this more accurately:

- Ask a friend to assess how strangers might see you.
- If you are a leader—or if you are exploring a corporate-level problem—consider getting the help of neutral outsiders to gain an external view of the organization.

Finally, with all three tactics for looking in the mirror, be prepared for possibly unpleasant discoveries. Sometimes you need to go through a bit of pain to find the best way forward.

# take their perspective

The strategy of taking their perspective is about deliberately investing time in understanding other people, thus avoiding wrong judgments about them and their actions. By getting into the habit of exploring a problem from the perspective of each stakeholder, you can get better at escaping the gravity well of your own worldview.

To do so, take the steps we discussed:

### 1. MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS

You’ll get other people wrong unless you invest genuine effort in trying to understand them. Avoid this pitfall by using a stakeholder map:

- List each of the parties or people involved in the problem. Remember to look for hidden stakeholders, too, as we covered in the **look outside the frame** strategy.
- For each stakeholder, think about his or her needs, emotions, and general point of view. What are that person’s problems? Goals? Beliefs? Context? What information do they have?

### 2. ESCAPE YOUR OWN EMOTIONS

When mapping the needs of the stakeholders, explicitly try to step away from your own perspective. If you do it with a group, remind your fellow group members that people may feel differently than they do themselves. Mention Johannes Hattula’s research:

> “Research has shown that people focus too much on their own perspective when trying to understand others. Try to disregard your own preferences. Focus only on how they might feel and think.”

By recruiting Tania Carr-Waldron to the pfizerWorks team, Jordan Cohen gained an invaluable resource who understood what people on Pfizer’s front lines thought and felt. This helped Cohen’s team build a useful service aimed at the right problems. If you don’t have much exposure yourself, can you find someone like Tania who does?

### 3. LOOK FOR REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS

With the slow elevator problem, most people simply assume that the tenants are lazy or impatient. Fewer think about good reasons why they complain: might they be late for an important meeting?

In the same way, remember that most people consider themselves to be good, reasonable people. To avoid falling prey to negative stereotypes and cynical thinking, consider what reasonable explanations might cause the behaviors you see:

- Could there be an innocent explanation?
- Do the other people have valid reasons to act as they do—ones that aren’t about stupidity or bad intentions?
- Is it possible that they are actually acting in my best interest—or that they at least think they are?
- Could this be a systems problem or an incentive problem, rather than a people problem?

# move forward

Take a look at your problem statements. For each one, figure out how to move forward.

### HOW CAN YOU TEST YOUR PROBLEM?

Novice problem solvers look to confirm their theory: *Isn’t my solution great? Let’s see if we can do it.* Expert problem solvers don’t try to confirm the framing they believe in—they look for ways to prove it wrong. Like Ashley did when Kevin pitched his gelato idea, is there a way to quickly engage with the real world to determine whether you are targeting the right problem?

To validate your framing of the problem, use one of the four tactics we covered:

- **Describe the problem to the stakeholders**. Like the Cisco team did, talk to the involved parties and describe the problem to them. Don’t try to sell them on your framing. As Steve Blank points out, the idea is to see if your framing resonates and to get them to give you more information.
- Get outsiders to help you. If you suspect you are too close to your own idea—or if you think people won’t give you honest feedback—can you use an outsider to help you? Remember Georgina’s story about the consulting firm that used her to validate their assumptions around branding.
- Devise a hard test. Recall how Managed by Q used a credit card sign-up to test whether people really felt strongly enough about the problem they had in mind. How can you set up a similar test for your problem (or your solution)?
- Consider “pretotyping” the solution. If it’s easy and risk-free to test a given solution, just go ahead and try it. Consider using Alberto Savoia’s concept of pretotyping to find nimble ways of testing your solution, like the BarkBox team did with their wine stopper idea.

These are not the only ways you can validate a problem. If you need more inspiration, consult the startup literature—or better yet, talk to someone who has startup experience, just like Kevin did with Ashley.

Finally, before you close the reframing loop and swing back into action, make sure you have planned your next reframing check-in.
