Frame Control Techniques

# Ignore It

This is your all-seasons workhorse.

Your standard answer when you don’t know what to do or say is to ignore.

Imagine this scenario, where some guy is trying to tool you by a pool:

> Tooler: hey dude, did you borrow your swimsuit from your grandma or what
> You: (glances in direction) hey man, what’s up (then turns away and ignores)

Notice that “ignoring” doesn’t necessarily mean that you pretend nobody said or did anything. Ignoring an insult you obviously heard often looks weird on your part, and it might suggest you’re panicking and don’t know what to do. The attacker might also feel like he needs to up his aggression to get your attention, and it might lead to a vicious cycle where he tries harder and harder.

Instead, look in his general direction, make very brief eye contact, acknowledge they said something, but ignore the actual content. Then turn back to what you were doing.

# Pick & Choose

This is how emotionally strong men control the frame.

The frame-buffet consists of picking and choosing something within their whole frame that best suit your needs.

It takes emotional strength because people’s natural reaction is to reply to what grabs more attention and to what hurts the most.Emotional detachment is also one of the central tenets of Thompson’s book “[Verbal Judo](https://thepowermoves.com/verbal-judo-summary/)“.

Once you can remain unaffected, then you got the power to decide.And you can decide if, how, when and *what* you want to address in whatever they said, without getting emotionally swept away by their unhelpful frame.

For example, if they attack you, you ignore the aggressive packaging of their frame and do *not* defend. Instead, you address the *content* of their frame as if it were a normal comment.

Steve Harvey does it well here:

>Ariana: (“you’re always making mistakes” aggressive frame) you keep making mistakes, it’s not Arihana, it’s Ariana (laughs)
>Steve: (doesn’t laugh, doesn’t defend) See, once again, let me show you something now…*

If Steve Harvey had laughed, he would have accepted Ariana’s frame. If he had defended, he would have also accepted her “I attack you” frame, and validated it. He would have played by *her* frame, and tacitly admitted his own incompetence.

Instead, **Steve Harvey won because he picked the bits of her frame that best suited him,** and he ran with it. He ignored the annoying *attitude* of her frame, he ignored the “you keep doing mistakes” part, and instead addresses the technicalities of name pronunciation *only*. Result: he looks in charge, she looks like an immature girl.

### Never Use “I” With Accusatory Frames

David Lieberman in his book “[Get Anyone to do Anything](https://thepowermoves.com/get-anyone-to-do-anything/)” provides a wonderful piece of advice to go with this technique. And it’s that you should never use the word “I” when someone is being rude. If you do, you take ownership of the issue. Instead, you want to keep the negativity with them.

For example:

>Him: You’re such an idiot, how can you even think such crap
>You: Wow, you seem really angry man, you must feel very strongly about this

That way, you keep the anger issue with *them*, instead of getting mired in their anger frame like most people would do.

# Use Humor to Control the Frame

“Be like water”, says Robert Greene in “[The 48 Laws of Power](https://thepowermoves.com/48-laws-of-power-summary/)“.

And that’s a great advice to learn frame control as well. Don’t think of frame control too squarely, as two frames fighting and one winning and one losing. **Think of your frames like water, transforming and adapting to suit the environment**.

Humor can used as a standalone or together with the other techniques we saw in here.

It can also be used to cut your losses.

Imagine this example:

>You: Of course you will love him, all mothers love their children
>Her: My mom didn’t love me
>You: OK, all mothers except yours
>Her: Ahaha
>You: Jokes aside, were you serious? I’m sorry to hear that, how come..

See what you did here? You avoided escalating an unnecessary frame battle, which you would have also likely lost, and instead turned into a joke. That’s great, because **you always want to avoid escalating frame you’re going to lose**.

When paint themselves into a corner and keep insisting, that’s when they look like real idiots with a thin-paper ego:

By realizing this was going to be a loss, you turned into a joke. You still “won” that frame battle but, in this case, there were no losers.

And second, you followed the most relevant thread: the new information. That shows you’re a socially intelligent person who cares. Someone who’s more focused on [bonding](https://thepowermoves.com/develop-deep-emotional-connection/) than on “winning”.

# Flip The Frame’s Meaning

Reagan, a master at frame control, often used the “frame flip”.

[On one occasion](https://youtu.be/fJhCjMfRndk?t=28s) Reagan’s flame flip, coupled with his humor, helped him win the presidency. Reagan’s old age was an issue in the campaign, and when asked about it, this is how Regan flipped it:

>Reagan: I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience

Big laugh by everyone, and he turned weakness into strength. Reagan *accepted* the original age frame, but twisted it to make a handicap for his opponent, not for him.

The power of this frame control technique is that instead of negating the initial frame, which would escalate into a battle of frames, you accept it and then win *within* their frame. This way, your opponent has no way to escape: *he* set the frame, and you beat him *within* his frame.

# Reshape it From Within

This one requires the ability to creatively think on your feet.

But if you are the kind of man with a silver tongue and a witty comeback always at the ready, the reshape technique is golden.

I don’t have a silver tongue. Except in some rare circumstances, as in the example below:

>Him: Hey man, don’t finish all the water
>You: There isn’t a single drop left

Here as well, I stay *within* their joking frame. But instead of taking it as it is, I transform it to the point where I can flip the power dynamics.

Don’t confuse this technique which is about “transforming their story” into “amplifying their story” which, as we shall see, is often a poor technique.

# Undermine Their Frame’s Authority

Have you ever been dealing with one of these:

- SJW / moral police
- [Dirty debaters](https://thepowermoves.com/ben-shapiro-debate-techniques/)
- [Manipulative negotiators](https://thepowermoves.com/dirty-negotiation-tactics/)

These people fight the frame battle by attaching higher values and ethics to their frames. **When people deem their frames as ethical and moral, they themselves become the moral authority**, and they become the judge of what’s right or wrong (see “[soft power](https://thepowermoves.com/soft-power/)“).

How to deal with these frames?

First of all, you want to challenge the authority and moral high ground of their frames. If you don’t do that and if you let them take the moral authority, then there is no way for you to win. If you don’t first address the higher authority that they claim, whatever you say and do, it will be rebranded as “unethical”.

A soft version of this the “moral framing” can be found with manipulative negotiators. For example:

>Him: Look, this is not about legal issues, this is about trust. And we’ve known each other for a while now, haven’t we?

Here they are framing the interaction from a trust point of view. They are being honest and forthcoming, and they deem you as being uncooperative.

And if you fight them without addressing the bigger moral frame based on trust, you become the “untrustworthy” one who refuses to negotiate for win-win.

In this case, I like what William Ury proposes ([Ury, 2007](https://thepowermoves.com/getting-past-no/)).For example:

>Him: Look, this is not about legal issues, this is about trust. And we’ve known each other for a while now, haven’t we?
>You: We’ve known each for a while, and it’s not about trust, it’s about…

And then you can reframe the issue with your own frame. For example, if you want to play the same [dirty negotiation games](https://thepowermoves.com/dirty-negotiation-tactics/), you pick another “high moral value” to attach to your frame. For example:

> You: It’s not about trust, it’s about fairness. And I don’t think you’re being fair here. The way I see it is…

In our era that reveres science, the “judge frame” works not only with moral and ethical authority, but also with scientific frames. Your typical [smart Alec](https://thepowermoves.com/the-7-archetypes-of-dominance/) will casually turbocharge his frame with sentences like “the consensus is… “, “research proves”, etc. etc. To handle that frame effectively, before even replying, you need to reframe their original frame as NOT the ultimate scientific fact. For example, you could say it’s just an opinion of theirs, and not science.

# Fight Fiery Frames With Fire

Sometimes your opponents will come out swinging.

They will use emotional outbursts, yelling, crying, blaming… These are all techniques that will put most people on the defensive. And of course, you don’t want to go on the defensive.

There are two options here:

1. Stay calm and let your logic win the battle
2. Meet them at their own level

The first option works best in high level public debates, because people can judge for themselves that you’re actually winning the debate with facts (see [Jordan Peterson using this technique](https://thepowermoves.com/peterson-vs-newman/)).

The second one works better in most daily situations. For example, when you’re arguing with a woman. Sometimes women will inject lots of emotions in their arguments. And the problem with remaining calm in the face of emotional outbursts is that the attacker gets more and more aggressive, the attack gains the momentum, and it becomes a never-ending onslaught.

Here is one example:

> Her: Hoooneeey, gooo! Do sometihng! Harry! Hurry!

Her frame is “this situation is terrible”. His frame is “this situation is amusing”. But since she injects so much emotion, he feels compelled to buy into her frame, right away and no questions asked.

That’s why, to stop the buck, you want to be meet people at their same level of aggression or “passion”.

# Use The Frame Mirroring Technique

Ben Shapiro and Piers Morgan us this frame control technique on each other.

See it in this example:

> Shapiro: and then when I say that’s a bullying tactic, you turn around and say that I’m bullying you for saying that. It’s absurd.

The truth is that they both engage in dirty debating tactics, but Shapiro was smart enough to realize and play the same back on Piers.

This is something you want to keep in mind for self-defense as well.

Some of the worst manipulators will accuse you of doing exactly what *they* are doing. This is also called “gaslighting” or “crazymaking”, and we saw it in action in [abusive relationships](https://thepowermoves.com/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship/).

And while most people go crazy when their opponent use this technique, you want to remain calm and in control, and accuse them right back. With plenty of evidence and examples to sustain your claim. Yes, it’s childish and you’d rather not play this game, but sometimes you must stoop down before you soar back up.

# Change the Rules of Engagement: Go One Step Sideways

This is the equivalent of ducking a punch and KO-ing with a kick.

The technique works like this:

1. You accept the confrontational frame
2. You reject the rules of the confrontation
3. You engage with your own rules

Instead of fighting blow by blow *within* their frame, you completely change the rules of the game to something that suits you better. The idea is to “bring a gun to the knife fight”.

Simply changing the rules will often result in mild shock from the attacker, which means you seized the day and are marching towards victory.

In the example below, the challenger’s frame was “confrontation through physical power (where I am stronger)”. Samantha instead twists it in “confrontation through status and connection (where I am stronger):

>Challenger: I know Taekwondo
>Samatha: I know the manager

Simple, yet genius.

Samantha reframes the rules of the contest and, without backing down, takes the high road. The effect is to slightly shame the challenger for going down the violent road. But at the same time, Samantha does not give up the fight. It simply changes the *terms* of the fight. And since our society reveres “civil” ways of winning arguments, Samantha trounces her challenger (and gains her respect).

# Go Wider: Make Your Frame Too General to Be Attacked

This is one of my favorite frame control techniques.

If you do it well, you can’t lose. In its simplest form, you just take a wider angle on life, you remain noncommittal, you appeal to general principles and, indirectly, you’re suggesting that “everything is relative”.

Yes, this is the philosopher’s way of frame control.And it’s unassailable.

For example:

>Him: These damn foreigners, coming to our country and stealing our jobs
>You: Our country, my country… What’s a country: an imaginary line that shifts around time. People have been moving around the world, country-less, for millions of years. It’s hard to say who truly belongs anywhere if go back long enough

You refuse his frame, but don’t really commit to anything here, which makes your frame hard to attack. If he wanted to continue debating you, it’s up to him to define “country”, which is very difficult, or to deny that people have been moving around for millions of years, which can’t be denied.

Or on the opposite side of the political spectrum:

>Him: If people complain that immigrants are stealing their jobs it means they’re really shit at their jobs
>You: Well, depends who we’re talking about. Usually the people lower in socio-economic status suffer the most from labor competition. When lots of people chase the same jobs, that puts downward pressure on salaries and weakens the laborers’ negotiation power

Again, you’re not saying that he’s a limousine liberal and it’s easy for him to say that as an executive.You make it about the general concept of supply and demand which, again, is very hard to refute.He can’t go anywhere from there.

I can also highly recommend this technique when you’re answering first. It gives far more power and weight to whatever you say (example in [Social Power](https://thepowermoves.com/courses/social-power/lessons/frame-control/)). Jordan Peterson makes himself unassailable in debates by using a philosopher’s frame.

# Go Deeper: Shame Their Frame

Alright, another favorite of mine.

It leverages the judge position, and it makes you the “intellectually dominant”, party.

It works like this:

You refuse their frame and, without saying they’re being [low-quality individuals](https://thepowermoves.com/low-quality-women/), you take the higher road and you show them, by contrast, that you are above them.

See here one example:

>Him: But you’re not like that
>Her: Aren’t you?
>Him: Not a drop. Not even half a drop (takes the higher road, shames her)
>Her: What’s wrong with you? (tries to shame him back, frame battle going on here)
>Him: I get it… You’ve never been in love(not afraid of holding his frame)

In this example, he ends up indirectly shaming her for having sex without feelings, for never having been in love. And he paints himself as morally superior, but also enjoying life at a deeper level. She ended lower down, and his value increased ten-fold. Powerful stuff.

[This is another good example](https://youtu.be/heifkOGToEo?t=128s), from the same series. He shames her curiosity by making nothing of his past at Studio 54. That way, he looks worldly and “intellectually superior”.

### Use It For Dating

In dating and seduction, when a girl tells you that “you only want sex”, you could go bold and say “yes”. And you’d lose the girl more than 90% of the time.

Instead, you want to use a similar technique.

Something like this:

>Her: I don’t want to go to your place. You will only want to have sex
>You: I might want, yes. But I disagree with the “sex only”. The only reason why I might want that is because I like you (reframes “only sex” to “I like you”). Sex is one of the pleasures of life, especially when two people like each other (reframes sex as normal). It’s one of the defining traits of romance, and romance is a beautiful thing. I love love and romance (reframes the whole interaction to romance). Don’t you also like love and romance? (asks her to contribute, seeking a collaborative frame)

That’s how you change the frame to go higher and deeper at the same time. In this case, you “win” the frame with a collaborative approach, and **winning the frame with a collaborative approach is the best you can achieve**. You win, but nobody loses. You score a win not for yourself, but for both. And you included her in the frame, which makes it far more likely she will follow you.
