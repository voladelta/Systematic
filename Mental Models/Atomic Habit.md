# How to Build Good Habits
1. Cue - Make it Obvious
A piece of information that suggests there’s a reward to be found, like the smell of a cookie or a dark room waiting to light up.
* Don’t hide your fruits in your fridge, put them on display front and center.

2. Craving - Make it 
The motivation to change something to get the reward, like tasting the delicious cookie or being able to see.
* Start with the fruit you like the most, so you’ll actually want to eat one when you see it.

3. Response - Make it Easy
Whatever thought or action you need to take to get to the reward.
* Don’t create needless friction by focusing on fruits that are hard to peel. Bananas and apples are super easy to eat, for example.

4. Make it Satisfying
The satisfying feeling you get from the change, along with the lesson whether to do it again or not.
* If you like the fruit you picked, you’ll love eating it and feel healthier as a result!
