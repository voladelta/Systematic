a particular kind of thinking.. understanding systems..

1. need to see behavior of system.. if we want a new medium for understanding systems in powerful new ways.. that’s (see behavior of system) what we can do now that we couldn’t do with pencil/paper

2. need to see entire state of the system.. across all variables all at once.. to compare et al

3. need to be able to adjust the system.. immediately be able to tell how behavior responds.. associations between what we’re changing and how behavior responds

4. need multiple representations of the system.. looking at behavior in diff ways thru diff lenses .. diff insight.. compare them..

5. not just see behavior but interact with it by measuring/searching/transforming it.. whatever makes sense..

the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by moving between levels of abstraction
[The Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/)
Concret A => Abstract => Concret B
Drawing => (Transpiler) Action => Code (Parametric)

=> time travel debugger
- go forward and backward to watch current state
- interract with and watch states and variables

Learning is about pattern recognition and in which context it can be used.

# Principles
[LearnableProgramming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming)
The design principles presented in this essay can be used as a checklist to evaluate a programming system for learning.

Does the environment allow the learner to...

read the vocabulary? -- Is meaning transparent? Is meaning explained in context, by showing and telling?
follow the flow? -- Is time visible and tangible? At all meaningful granularities?
see the state? -- Does the environment show the data? Show comparisons? Is hidden state eliminated?
create by reacting? -- Is something on screen as soon as possible? Is the parts bucket on the floor?
create by abstracting? -- Can the programmer start concrete, then generalize?


Does the language provide...

identity and metaphor? -- Is the computer's world connected to the programmer's world?
decomposition? -- Can the programmer break down her thoughts into mind-sized pieces?
recomposition? -- Can the programmer put diverse pieces together?
readability? -- Is meaning transparent?

This essay suggested some features and references that address these questions, but the questions matter more than my answers.

If you are designing a system and you can't answer these questions, it's time to reopen your sketchbook, because your design's not done yet.

# Ideas
Tool to make game or app faster like the ideas of diagram, flow, visual programming, like: Game Creator, BuildBox, Autocode, Blockly, Blueprint, Celestory, flowgorithm
Declarative make expressing thought faster than code like QML
Combine both visual and code like Ronin, Logic Driver
Parametric blender macro?
3d game prototyping?
Parametric, generative, procedural 
expander instead of transpiler?
