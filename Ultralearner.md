### 1. METALEARNING: FIRST DRAW A MAP
Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily.

### 2. FOCUS: SHARPEN YOUR KNIFE
Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it.

### 3. DIRECTNESS: GO STRAIGHT AHEAD
Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.

### 4. DRILL: ATTACK YOUR WEAKEST POINT
Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together again.

### 5. RETRIEVAL: TEST TO LEARN
Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information rather than
passively review it.

### 6. FEEDBACK: DON’T DODGE THE PUNCHES
Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

### 7. RETENTION: DON’T FILL A LEAKY BUCKET
Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.

### 8. INTUITION: DIG DEEP BEFORE BUILDING UP
Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things.

### 9. EXPERIMENTATION: EXPLORE OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE
All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.
