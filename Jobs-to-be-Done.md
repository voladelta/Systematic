[A Jobs to be Done Framework for Startups — JTBD Templates & Examples for Building Products Customers Want | First Round Review](https://firstround.com/review/build-products-that-solve-real-problems-with-this-lightweight-jtbd-framework/)


5 Whys/Upstream/Root causes

A clear JTBD statement should help you communicate with absolute clarity what a specific group of people want in a specific circumstance — and their barriers to getting it.

To put that into practice, here’s a JBTD statement template that I find helpful and is commonly used amongst Facebook and Instagram product teams:

-   When I ... (context)
-   But ... (barrier)
-   Help me ... (goal)
-   So I ... (outcome)

With those principles and end goal in the background, follow these four steps to gather all the info you’ll need to fill out your JTBD template:

1. Start by defining your audience clearly.

Think about the defining characteristics that help you develop a crystal-clear image your audience in your head of. Without a clear definition, you risk going too broad or gathering signal from the wrong kinds of people.

2. Ground yourself in market research.

Understand as much as possible about this audience’s behavior: what they currently are using to solve this specific problem and where they feel the most pain in the customer experience. Test out all the products related to what you’re building or what users have hacked together to accomplish the job. You should arrive at a clear understanding of the alternate products they are “hiring” or “firing” to accomplish the job and why.

3. Talk to your users.

Using surveys and interviews, get a firsthand account about your user’s mindset and decision process (related to what you are building). More specifically, try to:

- **Understand the underlying motivation and context:** What do they hope to do? Emotionally and functionally? Where were they and what is going on around them situationally?
    
- **Understand barriers and struggles:** What prevents them from getting this done?
    
- **Understand what they are currently “hiring” and “firing”:** What are they currently doing, or hacking together to get the job done? What do they not use because it doesn’t get the job done?

Whether you’re [using surveys or interviews, carefully word questions](https://firstround.com/review/why-qualitative-market-research-belongs-in-your-startup-toolkit-and-how-to-wield-it-effectively/) so that you are not leading people to a specific answer. For example, when we started concepting Tuned, we began by doing research into couples’ general communication patterns before asking specifically about apps for couples or the solutions we were thinking about. The problems we heard from these conversations helped us to prioritize amongst a range of ideas to focus on emotional connection over tactical task management, like keeping track of grocery lists.

> Stepping back to understand deeper context and underlying motivation is important because people are notoriously bad at predicting what they want.

4. Prioritize

There are many customer jobs your product could tackle, but focus is paramount here. From user interviews, look for themes that emerge in jobs to be done. You can also run surveys that ask users to rank the importance of jobs and how well each job currently is served by another app or product to gain a better understanding of the market opportunity. This can help you to narrow down jobs and prioritize those with the most demand and the largest gap to be filled.

### Discord

- **Core audience:** initially PC gamers
- **Motivations:** communicate synchronously while playing a game, find others and organize enough people to get a game going
- **Barriers:** split attention while playing a game makes it hard to use chat only, connecting with others who share your gaming interests and skill level
- **What else are they hiring/firing**: other social media, messaging apps

**Discord JTBD**: _When I want to jump into my favorite game, but I don’t know if there are people around to play, help me safely coordinate with a group of like-minded gamers, so I can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite multiplayer game._ This suggests features like making it easy to find people through public or private servers and switching easily from text to voice chat as you organize and jump into a game.

### Peloton

- **Core audience:** [upscale, fitness oriented super moms](https://askwonder.com/research/customer-demographics-peloton-market-and-consumers-g8kjyism0) (or dads)
- **Motivations:** Working out to staying healthy (feeling good and staying sane), working out as a social experience, quick but efficient exercise, variety and accountability
- **Barriers:** Difficult to go to the gym or to classes (because of kids)
- **What else are they hiring/firing**: Gyms or studios, other home gym equipment, outdoor exercise 

Peloton JTBD: _When I need an option to workout, but I can’t go to my favorite studio, help me to get a convenient and inspiring indoor workout, so I can feel my best for myself and my family._ This suggests features like an instructor-led experience, light social motivation through leaderboards and high fives and, most importantly, a physical bike are important core parts of the value.

### Segment

-   **Core audience:** startup developers and/or consumers of marketing/product analytics
    
-   **Motivations:** making faster and better informed business decisions using a full picture of analytics on customer behavior
    
-   **Barriers:** extremely laborious and highly error prone to access a full picture of customer data because it is collected across many interactions and sources
    
-   **What else are they hiring/firing**: separate data sources with bespoke integrations, existing ETL pipelines, other customer analytics platforms
    

Segment JTBD: _When I need to understand what people are doing on my platform, but I have different sources of data that all tell me different stories, help me easily pull together one source of truth so that I can make better product and marketing decisions to improve my business._ This makes clear the core value of Segment’s single API that allows companies to tap into dozens of analytics services to create a single view of a customer.

### Mutiny

-   **Core audience:** Account Based Marketers at B2B companies (note, this is only one persona out of the several that Mutiny considers as it’s core audience)
    
-   **Motivations:** accelerate sales by helping high value enterprise accounts understand and trust their company’s value
    
-   **Barriers:** limited time and resources, unsure what strategy will yield the best results
    
-   **What else are they hiring/firing**: ABM advertising platforms, online event software, email marketing
    

Mutiny JTBD: _When I need help enterprise accounts discover and trust our value prop, but I have limited time and resources to test different approaches that might resonate, help me quickly and confidently deliver the right message._ This makes clear [how Mutiny conveys its value prop](https://firstround.com/review/your-marketing-org-is-slow-heres-a-framework-to-move-faster/) — rather than focusing on its capabilities as a personalization platform, it suggests emphasizing ease of use and ROI when ABMs use their platform.

### Tuned

-   **Core audience:** Millennial couples, together for >6 months
    
-   **Motivations:** having a private space for their relationship, wanting to express themselves more fully to a partner, celebrating memories together
    
-   **Barriers:** Restricted emotional range and miscommunication via digital tools
    
-   **What else are they hiring/firing**: other digital communication tools
    

Tuned JTBD: _When I want to feel connected to my partner, but don’t have a special way to share my feelings, help me be more emotionally expressive, so we can strengthen our bond._ This suggests a set of features that give you a wider emotional range (like sharing your mood, stickers, greeting cards) to feel a moment of deeper connection with your partner vs. tactical features like keeping track of grocery lists.
