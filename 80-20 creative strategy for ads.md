1. Always start with statics:
	- Don't waste time on the "beautiful" or the "funny" video ad first
	- Statics are fast, easy, and effective.
	- Run tests and build a library of high-impact static ads.
	- Focus on themes like comparison images, infographics, lifestyle shots, and social proof statics.
2. Iterate based on data:
	- Test your ads, gather data, and see what clicks.
	- Use that data to refine and improve.
	- Ex: If a hook like "before and after" works, stick with it.
3. Optimize for conversions:
	- Let Google, Meta know what exactly 'conversions' mean for your business.
	- Ex: A prospect going through 5 different pages and following a series of steps may look like a conversion for you rather than a simple sign up.
4. Don't overlook ugly ads:
	-  "Ugly ads" are raw, low-production, and feel real.
	- Think simple smartphone videos or sticky note overlays.
	- They connect because they're authentic, not polished.
5. Expand with UGC and influencers:
	- Once you see some success with statics, bring in UGC and influencers.
	- Video ads, carousels-these formats excel in stories and reels.
	- They bring authenticity, making your ads relatable.
6. Know the cost of testing:
	- Testing isn't just about spending money. It's an investment.
	- Start small to avoid burning your budget.
	- Scale up when you see what's working.
