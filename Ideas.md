## Declarative CLI for business tasks
I hate redundant work. Employees spend countless hours on tasks that could be automated. Tools like Zapier have democratized building automation. Personally, I love the UX of the CLI. Imagine running quick scripts, backed by Zap-like recipes, to accomplish weekly tasks and pull data. Companies like Command E, and Akido are just starting to make inroads in this space. I'm excited to see increasingly powerful capabilities built!

## Universal shortcuts - A productivity meta-layer for super-users
As we spend increasing time on our computers, saving milliseconds on an often-repeated task can add up. One way to improve efficiency would be by creating a central shortcut library. The product would standardize shortcut keys used across different applications, allowing consumers to customize keys for canonical behavior. Users should be able to create a new email and create a new to-do with the same shortcut key, as opposed to memorizing "C" for Superhuman and "Cmd+N" for Things, for example.

Society will grow accustomed to shortcut keys as younger generations age and use more business and productivity applications. There should be a simple way for developers to support this behavior and allow cross-app defaults.

## Meme School - Learning stuff is HARD but memes make everything EASY + GOOD
Whether it's remembering equations or keeping track of who conquered Constantinople, why do we have to learn only from blobs of text and linear video? Memes are the internet's native vessel for ideas and shared experiences, and with so much learning now happening online, let's apply it to education! I'd love to see a marketplace for study material driven by original, nutritious memes.
