# THE 15 BUILDING BLOCKS OF A SALES LETTER

## Pre-head.

The pre-head is also sometimes referred to as the “eyebrow.” I guess that assumes that you think of a sales letter as a face. Because it’s a sentence fragment usually found at the top left of the sales letter, it may look a bit like an eyebrow. That’s a stretch, but it’s the closest thing to an explanation I’ve found that sounds reasonable.

It might look something like this: “Attention, Pug Owners!”

Now, if you’re the owner of a dog that belongs to the pug group, that’s going to grab your attention quickly.

How do I know? Because I am a proud Pug owner, and I can tell you that anytime I see something that’s directed to Pug owners, it’s got my attention. I want to know: What do you have for me? Help me spend some money on my dog!

That’s how the pre-head works. It is a short sentence fragment designed to grab the reader’s initial attention. It works very well regardless of what your product might be.

If you have a product that’s designed to help people learn to play guitar, the pre-head could simply be: “Attention, guitar students!” Or, if you have a product that’s targeted toward people learning to fly airplanes, it could be: “Attention, student pilots!” Or, if your product is for parents whose children suffer from ADHD, it could be: “Attention, parents of ADHD kids!”

You’re targeting the prime prospect for your message and you’re qualifying him or her. You’re saying, in essence, “Do you belong to this group? If you do, this message is for you. Pay attention!”

## Headline.

The headline is the “ad for the rest of the ad.” Its job is to make the reader want to keep on reading—specifically, to get him or her to read the next sentence. That’s all your headline has to do.

Studies show that you have about two seconds to grab the attention of people who are reading your copy for the first time. That’s how long it’s going to take them to decide whether or not they’re going to keep on reading. In many cases, they’re going to click the button and they’ll be gone.

So you’ve got to do your job well in the headline and really grab their attention. An example sales letter headline:

“They All Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano.

But When I Started to Play...”

You may wonder why I keep referring to an “ad.” What exactly do I mean by “ad”? Well, the kinds of websites that we’re writing are websites that sell. Often they’re referred to as a “sales letter” website, and what that means is that it’s written in letter format as if it were a letter on paper. Often it’s on one long, scrolling web page.

This is the primary tool of the online direct response marketer (that’s you!), because it’s been proven to be the most effective tool for the purpose. I refer to that as an ad, and I also refer to an e-mail that’s trying to make a sale as an ad, and I also refer to a Facebook ad as an ad. Whatever copy you’re writing, for the purposes of our discussion in this book, it is an ad.

Each of those items that I just mentioned—the e-mail, the sales letter, Facebook ads—has a headline, so the principles apply, even though the execution may be somewhat different. You can compare this formula to just about any sales letter you encounter online, and you’ll see they all follow it to the letter.

## Deck Copy.

Some people call this the subhead, but I think that’s inaccurate because we have another block (in our imaginary “stack” of building blocks) that we’re going to call a subhead. So I want to distinguish that from the deck copy, which comes right underneath the headline.

The Deck Copy will be a block of type that is usually in black bold type and set apart from the rest of the text. It comes between the headline and the beginning of the letter. An example of good Deck Copy:

Revealed on this page...

• The Crucial ADD/ADHD ‘Misconception’: your child isn’t “deficient” in anything...

• The System Meltdown: Why the system (and its treatments) has been unable to awaken your child’s hidden genius...

• YOURS FREE – Exclusive Access To a Once In a Lifetime Teaching Series:

I’m teaming up with 7 other expert ADD/ADHD doctors to blow the lid off this problem and show you how to unwrap the hidden gifts of ADD/ADHD in your child –and did I mention it’s ALL completely FREE?”

The job of the Deck Copy is to reinforce the impact, and expand on the idea proposed in the headline. It can also be used to arouse more curiosity.

These next few blocks correspond to the “A” and the “S” in P.A.S.T.O.R. – we amplify the pain, and we tell the story of our solution.

## Lead.

This is the very beginning of the body of the sales letter. This is the part that comes after “Dear Friend.” It can be one paragraph, two, or several. Sometimes it consists of a simple “if, then” statement; sometimes it consists of a story that is intended to persuade you to think in a certain way.

The lead sets the criteria for whom the letter is intended, and what they stand to gain by reading the rest of the copy. Think of the classic lead, which goes something like this:

> “If you’ve struggled to lose weight, if you’ve tried every diet imaginable, if you’ve taken every pill, if you’ve tried exercise routines, machines and personal coaches and you still haven’t taken the weight off; then you’re about to read the letter you’ve been waiting for all your life. Here’s why...”

That’s a strong lead. Does it do what we just talked about? Does it set the criteria for the intended reader? Does it tell you what you stand to gain by reading the letter? Apparently it’s going to tell you how to lose the weight even if you’ve tried all this other stuff that never worked.

## Body.

This is the bulk of your text; most of your sales letter. It also contains all the other elements that we’re about to list. You can almost look at these top four as the main elements of the letter and the remaining parts as sub-elements that fall within the body.

Before we move on with the list, let me say a word or two about how to do the research necessary to write your ad. The first thing I do is a simple Google search on your product, and also on your target market (example: search “pug” as well as “pug owner,” “pug lover,” “pug training,” etc.). Try to form in your mind what your market is looking for and start searching for keywords that they might use. In other words, pretend you’re a Pug owner looking to find something you need or want for your pooch.

Another way to do this research is to think about the generic terms used for the product category that you’re working with, and take those generic terms and combine them with the word forum.

That’s a great way to find places where people are discussing your topic online. You can just lurk, read the threads in the discussion forums, and see what people are talking about. Look for topics that keep coming up over and over again.

If you find there are webinars hosted for the market to which you’re writing copy, get on those calls. Listen to the questions that are asked. If there are “real-world” seminars, go to those seminars and talk to people who are there—not about your product, but about their problems. Especially attend the question-and-answer sessions at real-world seminars. Listen to the questions that people are asking.

My friend Armand Morin—who has built multiple million-dollar brands online—initially built his business by attending seminars. He was at a seminar once, taking notes - but not very many notes. The person next to him asked, “Armand, aren’t you getting much out of this?”

He said, “It’s great! I’m getting a lot out of this!”

His friend said, “But you’re not taking very many notes.”

Armand’s response: “Oh, I’m just writing down the questions that people are asking. That’s how I know what products to create.”

## Subheads.

These are smaller headlines that separate the major sections of your sales letter. I refer to them as the “bucket brigade” of your copy.

In the olden days before there were automobiles and big red fire trucks, there was the bucket brigade. This was a group of people in a village or town who would run down to the river or the lake and form a line between the water and the burning building. They stood within arm’s reach of one another. The person nearest the water scooped up a bucket of water and handed it to the next person in line, and it would get passed along until it reached the burning building, where the person at the end of the line dumped the bucket of water on the flames. Then the bucket would be returned to the water source to be re-filled and passed back through the line to the fire. That’s how they would put the fire out.

I’d like to take credit for inventing the “bucket brigade” analogy ... but I can’t. I don’t know if David Garfinkel of the World Copywriting Institute is the person who invented it, but I heard it from him first.

Subheads act like your own bucket brigade. They lead your reader through the body of your copy to get the gist of your message. My good friend and copywriter Michel Fortin says there are three things that prospects who read your copy “never do at first” (notice the “at first;” it’s the job of your copy to change that!).

Prospects never read anything at first; they never believe anything at first; and they never buy anything at first.

At first they’re not going to read your letter... they’re going to glance at your headline and decide whether you’re getting any more of their attention.

If you hold their attention, then there are three things they’re going to do next. They’re going to “skim, scroll and scan.” They skim through your letter and see if there’s anything of interest to them. They’re going to scan your subheads to get the gist of your story.

They’re going to scroll down your letter as they skim, and they’re going to scan it for things that they are interested in. If you can capture their attention while they’re doing this, you’ve overcome the first thing they never do. Remember, they never read anything at first.

If, and only if, you’ve captured their attention during this process of “skim, scroll and scan” with your powerful headline and persuasive subheads, they will go back to the top of your letter and begin to read.

**Second, people never believe anything at first.** So now that they’re reading, the job of your copy becomes to overcome their disbelief and skepticism and tell them the story they wanted to hear from the beginning.

I had a conversation with somebody today, talking about the difference between manipulation and persuasion. In my opinion, manipulation is using tricks to convince people to do things they didn’t want to do in the first place, things that are not in their best interest. Persuasion, on the other hand, is using tactics to persuade people to do something that is in their best interest, and that they wanted to do to start with.

Think about your own experience when you’re online and searching for something... perhaps a copywriting course like my own Copywriting Academy. At first, you’re going to “skim, scroll and scan” the website and decide if this is for you. When you see there are some things that interest you, you stop and begin reading.

What you really want, in this scenario, is to be convinced that this copywriting course will answer your questions and provide you with the ability to make more sales.

**That’s what your prospects want as well.** That’s the difference between manipulating them and persuading them.

If you can **get past the fears that cause them to object** to doing what you ask them to do, then you can move them to the next of those three things that people never do at first.

**Finally, people never buy anything at first**, but if you’ve overcome the first two, overcoming the third is often just a matter of asking. The subheads serve as the bucket brigade that moves that process along.

## Rapport.

What we mean by rapport is relationship building. People like three kinds of people: one, those who are like themselves; two, those they would like to be; and three, those who like them back. Those are the keys to building rapport. Rapport is building your relationship, a friendly relationship that makes a person feel understood and valued. An example of good rapport building copy, from a sales letter about a gold instruction product:

> “If you’ve ever suspected — like most good golfers I know — that the best way to get really good at golf is to just figure it out yourself... you now have proof it’s true.”

Rapport demonstrates that you know the reader’s pain, that you understand his or her problems, and that you have some common experiences that you can share that proves you understand his or her pain.

Dr. Stephen Covey’s book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People says that one of those habits is to “seek first to understand, then to be understood.”

That’s what building rapport is all about. This should not be a manipulative process. It can be used for those purposes; however, I hope that you won’t do that.

All these techniques that we discuss, these psychological tactics, are powerful motivators of human behavior. I hope you understand that when I tell you that I want you to promise to only use them for good purposes, I mean it. These very tactics that we use in writing good sales copy, persuasive sales copy, can also be used to manipulate other people to do things that are not in their best interest.

I refuse to use these tactics that way, and it is my hope that you will as well. Rapport-building is a powerful tactic for persuading certain behaviors, so use it with care.

## Bullet Points.

A bullet point is a brief statement that identifies a single benefit offered by your product or service. It usually doesn’t reveal how that benefit is derived.

What do I mean? First of all, the reason they’re called bullets is because they often appear in bullet point fashion on a sales letter. That’s because bullet points are extremely scannable; they’re easy to read. There’s lots of white space around them; they’re short; they’re punchy; and if you format them correctly, a reader can gather a lot of information by scanning over bullets very quickly.

Copy that converts at a high rate (i.e., makes a lot of sales) usually has a lot of bullets. Bullets are very powerful sales tools, and I’m going to urge you to use lots of them. That’s why we will spend an entire chapter on writing bullets and how it’s done. There are some very specific techniques that I think you’re going to find very helpful.

Want an example of a great bulleted list? Here’s one from a sales letter written by world-class copywriter Clayton Makepeace:

My stunningly simple secrets for closing more sales in a month than most do in a year.

1. You’ll discover the six foundations of a powerful close.
2. Seven never-fail closing themes that work for any assignment.
3. Plus two closing blunders that could cost you everything at that final decisive moment.

Now, don’t you wonder what those are?

That’s the purpose of a bullet point... to create that curiosity reaction that makes you think, “I’ve got to know what that is!” Think about your own experience buying products from websites. Have you ever bought a product because you just had to know what one specific bullet was talking about? I have!

These next two blocks, 9 and 10, correspond to the “T” in P.A.S.T.O.R. – testimonials (and proof).

## Credibility.

You often see this section of a sales letter started with a subhead that says, “Who am I and why should you listen to me?” That’s a classic subhead line that is often used by marketers.

It works. You must build credibility with your prospects in order for them to lower the resistance they’re naturally feeling. Why do they feel this resistance?

Fear. When they’re shopping online, they’re afraid of giving you their credit card number. They’re afraid of giving you their e-mail address, their contact information. They’re afraid you’re going to rip them off. One of the keys to overcoming this fear is to establish your credibility.

Establishing credibility will answer the top question that they have once they’ve started reading your letter and that is, “Why should I listen to what this person has to say?”

## Testimonials.

Testimonials are third-party verification that your solution does what it claims to do. These third parties are credible people, who have used your product or service, liked it, and are willing to endorse it.

We’ve all seen them. We’ve all seen testimonials used. Most of us probably know by now that just using someone’s initials in a testimonial is not as effective as using his or her full name.

The most believable testimonial is one that is done on video and obviously not done by an actor. We can all tell when a real person gives a truly heartfelt testimonial on video as opposed to when an actor or actress gives a testimonial.

So, you want to make your testimonials as believable as possible. Usually that means getting a video testimonial.

The next best thing is to get a photograph of the person, not a studio shot, but a candid shot, and include his or her full name and website address or, even better, his or her phone number. Most people won’t agree to sharing their phone number publicly, and of course you must be respectful of that. But using a phone number in a testimonial is deadly effective for making sales. My clients who have used phone numbers in testimonials report that very few people actually call the phone number. Those who do just want to determine if it’s a real person, so the calls are generally very short.

Using the phone number of someone who’s giving you a testimonial really enhances the believability of that testimonial. This starts to tie a lot of the elements of a sales letter together. The testimonial enhances believability, which enhances credibility, which means people let their guard down, which means it’s easier to build rapport and to get them to accept the promise of your offer. Do you see how these things begin to weave together? That’s how we form the fabric of a good sales letter.

Now, if you’re just starting out, of course, you may not have any testimonials. In this case, you could use quotes from famous people, as long as it’s clear you’re not implying that the famous person is personally endorsing your product. (If he or she is, good for you!)

For example, if you have a product about doing better advertising, you could include this quote from Mark Twain inside a testimonial box: “Many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising.”

Now, that isn’t specifically about your product, but it supports your premise that advertising is important and can make a difference in your business. Besides, it’s from Mark Twain! People will read that and think, “Mark Twain’s a genius. This guy must know what he’s talking about!”

You can also use quotes from articles in research from credible sources. If you have a quote from a story you saw on CNN, you can use that, as long as you stay inside the boundaries of fair use. You can’t steal someone’s copyrighted material, but you can certainly use quotations from people in authority that would be persuasive with your audience.

These next few blocks correspond to the “O” in P.A.S.T.O.R. – we are building the offer (which is really the transformation our product produces).

## Value Justification.

This is where you start to talk about how valuable your product, service, or solution actually is to the user. You highlight the value to your offer and do it in a way that contrasts it favorably to the price. Here’s a good example...

If you are selling a course that teaches people how to save at least $10,000 on their income tax, then talk about the fact that they’re going to save at least $10,000 and some people will even save $14,000, or $20,000.

Then when you reveal the price of your product being $500, it contrasts very favorably with the $10,000 in savings. I mean, really, who wouldn’t hand over $500 in order to get $10,000 back? Would you give me a quarter if I give you a dollar in return? That’s the value proposition that you’re trying to set up, or “value justification.”

My goal when writing copy is to demonstrate the value to the buyer is at least 10 times the price.

## Risk Reversal.

Let’s review what we’ve accomplished so far. We’ve grabbed the reader’s attention, built the case that we have a solution to his or her problem, brought him or her to the place of building rapport, established our credibility, showed him or her all the benefits of our product, demonstrated for him or her how it’s worked for other people, and established how valuable the product could be. Now we come to the real crux of the matter: removing any sense of risk-taking that our prospect may be feeling.

The simplest form of risk reversal is simply to say you have a 100 percent money back guarantee. You’re telling them, in effect, “Try the product. If it doesn’t work, you get your money back, so what have you got to lose?”

Now, of course, you have a couple of things to overcome. First of all, people have heard the phrase “100% money back guarantee” so often that it has become audio wallpaper to them. It has lost a lot of its meaning because it’s been used so often—it’s almost a cliché.

Your job is to find a way to express the guarantee or the risk reversal in such a way that you’re taking all the risk off their shoulders and putting it onto yours, so that they feel they’re taking no risk at all.

For instance, perhaps you’re selling e-books. Instead of just saying, “You get a 100% money back guarantee when ordering my e-book,” you might write something like this:

> “Download my e-book, read it, and if you don’t like it, then just e-mail me and I’ll give you all your money back. I’m taking a risk by doing this. I can’t make you give the e-book back. I can’t get the atoms back off your computer when you download the digital e-book, so you could just order the e-book, ask for a refund and rip me off, but I’m going to trust that you’re not going to do that to me.”

In those few sentences, you’ve made it obvious that the risk is really all yours.

The risk is not being taken by the prospect at all. And yes, it’s true, a certain percentage of people will do exactly what your copy “suggests,” they will rip you off by downloading the e-book and immediately asking for the refund. But not most people—in my experience, most people are honest.

By describing the situation in those terms, it’s really not any different than offering a 100 percent money back guarantee. It’s just using language that more vividly illustrates the fact that the seller is shouldering the risk, not the buyer. By doing so, you remove one of the biggest obstacles to making the sale.

## Bonuses.

Your bonus is a related but unexpected gift that enhances the value of your offer. I want you to think carefully about what I just said— first, it’s unexpected. Those of us in the marketing world expect there’s always going to be a bonus, but in “the real world,” where folks are not accustomed to seeing sales letters, and certainly not accustomed to studying them, prospects often are surprised.

Let’s say you’re selling an information product, a course on how to lose thirty pounds in thirty days, and people are reading your sales letter, which says you’re going to give them instruction on how to do this very remarkable thing. They notice at the bottom of the page that you’re offering a bonus. It’s a workbook. This workbook will give them a place to record their progress, and it’s absolutely free, if they order today.

It’s worth $19, but you’re going to give it to them for free. Now, that’s an unexpected bonus; it’s related to your primary offer, and it’s valuable. It increases or enhances the value of your offer. That is a good bonus. The mistake I see people making in their online sales letters is offering bonuses that are not related to the product that they’re selling and that don’t enhance the value of their product.

Think of the bonus as the “extra degree.” Here’s what I mean: it takes 212 degrees of heat to boil water. Water at 211 degrees is very hot – but it is not boiling. When water boils, the steam generated can produce electricity or power an engine that moves a train or a ship. The extra degree of heat takes potential and turns it into action.

That’s the situation with the prospect reading your sales letter. If you’ve done all the other parts right, they’re at 211 degrees and you need to find a way to get that extra degree to make that water boil; to generate steam, and to make the sale happen. Your bonus is that extra degree, that extra nudge that pushes the prospect over the edge.

These final two blocks correspond to the “R” in P.A.S.T.O.R. – we are Requesting a Response (in other words, we’re asking for the sale).

## Call to Action or “Explicit Offer.”

The Explicit Offer is sometimes called “the Call to Action.” We have, up until now, been building the case for the transformation our product or service produces. You may want to think of that as the implicit offer. The explicit offer is simply the place in the copy where we ask for the order and tell the reader what to do. You say, “Okay, these are the details of what I’m selling you, and here’s what you need to do: click this button and order now,” or “Order your copy now,” or “Download this product immediately,” or “Get instant access.” However you phrase it, you’re basically saying, “Okay, I’ve explained all the reasons why; now it’s time for you to buy.”

Oddly enough, this is often a place where many business owners and marketers take a step back and become shy and reclusive, not as aggressive as they should be in asking for the sale. By the way, this also happens in real-world sales—face-to-face selling. Often a salesperson will be at an appointment with a potential buyer and will go through the entire process of selling, but won’t ask for the sale.

You have to ask for the sale in order to get it. I guarantee you’ll lose 100 percent of the sales that you don’t ask for.

## P.S.

Don’t underestimate this one.

I know it’s kind of a cliché that online sales letters have five, six, or ten PS’s. Don’t engage in that nonsense. The research that I’ve seen shows that either one or three PS’s seem to work best. You certainly don’t need any more than that.

I usually just use one.

**Here’s why the PS is important**: Remember that readers skim, scroll, and scan. They start at the top and scroll all the way to the bottom. Why? Because they want to know, “What is this person selling and how much is it?” and that’s usually near the bottom of the page.

So, often they’ll scroll all the way to the bottom, and if you put a good, properly formatted PS at the bottom, you can restate your entire proposition in one sentence. This is the place where you sum up the top benefit that your product offers. If the copy is online, supply a link to the order form. An example of a good P.S.:

> “P.S. The time is now. Those big corporations are going to keep taking from you till you’ve got nothing left to give. Do you have the courage to fight back? Your chance to make all your dreams come true has arrived. Will you go for it? Will you take action? CLICK HERE TO DO IT NOW.”

# 5 ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF A COMPELLING HEADLINE

Grabs Attention. Your headline’s number-one job is to **grab the reader’s attention**. To accomplish this, your headline must either: make a claim or promise, evoke an emotional response, or stir up curiosity.

Examples:

- Can You Really Be Younger Next Year?
- Which Of These Five Mistakes Do You Make on Your Blog?

Screens and Qualifies Readers. Choose specific words that **segment out the exact “tribe” you want to reach**. Headlines that apply to everyone can just as easily apply to no one.
Examples:

- Why New Authors Fail, and What to Do about It
- Top 10 iPad Apps For Entrepreneurs

Draws Readers into the Body Copy. Remember you’re not selling your concept or proposition in the headline. You’re making one sale only: the idea of reading the rest of the post.
Examples:

- How to Write a Book in Seven Days
- Does God Want You to Be Rich?

Communicates the “Big Idea.” What is the one true benefit of your post, and how can you communicate that to your readers in a way that is meaningful to them? Put that in your headline.

Examples:

- Triple Your Productivity Instantly
- The Customer Is Not Always Right

Establishes Credibility. Authority is one of the most powerful ways of gaining attention. If you have an “authority card” to play, play it in the headline if possible.
Examples:

- Ph.D. Psychologist Reveals Secret Of Self-Discipline
- Harvard Study Shows 3 Common Traits Of Successful People

# 5 HEADLINE TEMPLATES TO MAKE MORE SALES TODAY

## The “How-To” Headline.

The key to making this particular headline work is that you need to tie it to a benefit your reader cares about (related to your content, of course). Examples:

- How to Write a Blog Post Every Day
- How to Land More Clients As a Freelancer

## The “Transactional” Headline.

This headline is all about the promise. When you truly have “Wow!” level content, this headline will grab attention. Examples:

- Give Me 30 Minutes And I’ll Give You More Blog Traffic
- Try These 5 Tactics for a Week, And Be Twice As Productive

## The “Reason-Why” Headline.

Robert Cialdini cites the power of the word “because” in his book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. His research showed that simply adding the word “because” to a request makes it more likely you’ll get what you’re asking for.

Advertising copywriters have known this secret for a long time. Decades earlier, John E. Kennedy wrote a modest little book called Reason Why Advertising, which has become a classic in the field.

Use the power of the “reason why” in your headlines. Examples:

- Why Your Blog Posts Get Ignored, And How to Fix That
- 7 Reasons You Should Be Using Social Media In Your Marketing

## The “Probing Question” Headline.

With this kind of headline, you ask a question that creates an intense desire to know the answer. Be careful with these headlines. If you ask a question like “Do You Want to Know My Blogging Secret?” You might get a discouraging answer, such as, “No.”

The kind of question you want to ask is one that really evokes strong curiosity, or taps into a problem you know your reader has. Examples:

- Why Don’t Doctors Get Sick?
- Do You Wish More People Bought Your Book?

## The “If-Then” Headline.

With this headline, you contrast something that’s easy for your reader to do with the major benefit of your post. Examples:

- If You Can Send and Receive E-mail, You Can Build a Platform
- If You Can Follow a Recipe, You Can Write Better Headlines

# 21 WINNING BULLET POINT TEMPLATES

## Wrong

What do I mean by the “wrong” bullet? The wrong bullet is simply a case where you can contradict a common assumption. You get the reader to state a belief that he or she has, then you tell them, “Wrong!”

For instance, if you’re writing copy for health products, perhaps a nutritional supplement that is designed to reduce high blood pressure, then you might write a bullet that says something like this:

• Eating lots of salt in your diet is bad for your blood pressure, right? **Wrong**! We’ll explain why when you order our special report.

You can see why contradicting a commonly held assumption captures the attention of the reader and makes him or her want to know the secret behind the bullet. Of course you need to have some factual basis to back up the claim you’re making. You can’t make a claim that’s controversial simply for the sake of controversy, unless you can back the claim up. Assuming that you can, this is a very effective bullet type to use.

## Themed Sequence

This is a case where you are going to spell out, for instance, the “seven deadly diet sins,” or the “three humiliating secrets men don’t want women to know.”

How might you employ themed sequence bullets in your copy? You might have a section that reads like this:

The 7 Deadly Diet Sins That Keep You Fat

1. The three foods you should never eat that are recommended by almost every diet doctor. Eat these foods, and you’re sure to stay fat.
2. Why the time of day you exercise is very important, and why most diet gurus have this information wrong.
3. And so on...

One quick note: just because they are bullet points doesn’t mean you have to use actual bullets. Numbers work well, too. If you’re spelling out the “three humiliating secrets men don’t want women to know,” then those bullets should be “1-2-3,” instead of black circular dots or checkmarks.

## Two-step

A two-step bullet offers a parenthetical elaboration on the main benefit statement. Let me explain. This parenthetical statement is the real magnet in the bullet.

When you have a blind bullet in your copy and you want to heighten the amount of curiosity that is aroused by it, after your initial bullet statement, in parentheses, make another statement that really makes people think about what it is you’re trying to tell them.

For instance, if you’re writing a sales letter about a product on networking, one of your bullets might say...

**What to never do with your business card, and why.** (If you get this wrong, people will walk away and you’ll never hear from them again.)

That’s a parenthetical statement that heightens the curiosity and enhances or elaborates on the main benefit statement. The implied benefit behind this, of course, is, if you know these myths, you’ll be able to avoid these mistakes, and therefore, people will remember you and will call you back.

This is an important point to remember: even when you are talking about mistakes people make, you’re talking about benefits—because it’s beneficial to learn to avoid them.

## Giveaway

Every now and then in your bullets you should give something away. Give them good information. In fact, I would go so far as to say, give away your best information. Give away your best tricks.

Don’t be afraid to give away information, especially information that’s self-explanatory in its value. Most marketers are afraid readers will know they’ve just received the best you have to offer and won’t buy anything from you.

Research shows this is not the case. If you can give people a tip or trick that’s stunningly good, they are more likely to think, “If that’s what they’re giving away in their sales promotion, what are they hiding behind the scenes? If the free stuff is this good, what kind of information do I get when I pay it?” You don’t want to give away all of your best information, but giveaway bullets, used sparingly, are very effective at credentializing the value of your information.

## Reverse Hook

This is a bullet that presents, first, an interesting fact, and then presents an unexpected benefit that arises from that interesting fact.

For instance, let’s say you’re in the pay-per-click marketing space and you’re selling a pay-per-click marketing course that teaches people how to use Google AdWords to drive traffic to their site. One of the challenges in that marketplace is being able to select profitable keywords that generate enough traffic to yield measurable results.

So, you might be able to use a “reverse hook” bullet that’s based on real statistical information. It might say something like, “37.1% of the keywords in your Google AdWords account are not getting enough traffic to give you reliable test data.” Now, this is the parenthetical statement, “Here’s a simple trick you can use to eliminate these keywords from your ad campaigns forever and save yourself loads of money.”

That is a reverse hook bullet. It’s an interesting fact that brings an unexpected benefit if you know how to use the information correctly.

## Naked Benefit

This bullet makes a direct benefit claim, but it has got to be supported by some additional facts, or what I call “intrigues” that deepen your reader’s interest. You may not be able to come up with a creative way to describe every single benefit you’re writing bullets for in your sales copy.

You may just need to go ahead and talk directly about the benefit.

For instance, if you are selling a product on how to generate lots of creative ideas, your bullet point—which spells out a naked benefit— might be “how to effortlessly generate dramatically different ideas and know instantly if they are worth pursuing.”

The benefit is being able to come up with good ideas.

## Transactional

This is very similar to a headline template. It’s simply a proposition that says, “Give me (X), and I’ll give you (Y).” It might be something as simple as, “Give me one hour, and I’ll teach you how to write effective headlines,” or, “Give me three days, and I’ll teach you how to buy property with no money down.”

It’s a transaction. Whenever you’re using a transactional bullet, it’s often best if you can use it in a case where what you’re asking from your readers seems of small consequence in contrast to the benefit you’re offering to them.

Let’s say, for instance, you are writing copy for a product that offers training in how to use QuickBooks software, and this software teaches users of QuickBooks a simple way to automatically categorize their transactions. In fact, by using your method, they can do in five minutes what used to take them an hour each day to do.

Then you can say something like, “Give me 15 minutes, and I’ll teach you how to save 45–55 minutes every day from now on.” That’s a transactional bullet that makes the transaction seem like a no-brainer for your prospect.

## If-Then

In this bullet type, you’re giving the prospect something easy for him or her to do or comply with, and you’re associating it to a more valuable benefit.

For example:

• If you can spare 10 minutes a day, you can lose five pounds a month.

Or...

• If you can send or receive e-mail, then you can learn to make stock trades online in total safety.

You can also use this type of bullet as a qualifier:

• If you are over the age of 50 and have found it difficult to get life insurance, these three simple questions will often get you approved for a life insurance application.

Even though we’re just going through twenty-one bullet types, I hope you can see that you can take each of these bullet types and mix them up and combine them in different ways. You really have hundreds of possible types of bullets you can use, so you’re never again stuck for creativity.

You can always come back to this list and ask yourself, “What ‘wrong’ bullets can I write? What themed sequence bullets could I write? What two-step bullets could I write? What giveaway? What reverse hook? How can I write a naked benefit bullet?”

Some of them may duplicate one another and cross over, but that’s okay, because you’re expressing the same ideas in different ways. Then you can whittle these down to fine-tune your copy.

So remember when you’re going through your bullet writing exercise, don’t edit while you’re writing—just write. If you sat down and wrote five bullets for each type, then you would have 105 bullets to choose from for your copy.

## Truth About

This works especially well with any controversial question or issue that is hotly debated. Find an issue where the controversy is well-known in your market. For instance, in the weight loss market you could write about carbohydrates. As one of your bullet points in your weight loss product copy, you can say, “The truth about carbohydrates - and chances are, it’s not what you think it is.”

That’s a great example of a polarized topic: the role carbohydrates play and how you should manage them in your diet. You can polarize people and catch their interest, whichever side of the issue they may fall upon, simply by using the “truth about” bullet.

## Single Most

Use this type of bullet when you have a superior benefit that you can prove. Exercise a little bit of caution with this, because you want to make sure you truly do have the superior benefit and that you really can prove it.

If you have the fastest, easiest, and lowest risk way of lowering your blood pressure, then you should boldly say so: “The single fastest, easiest, and best way of lowering your blood pressure documented and approved by the American Medical Association.”

Of course I don’t know what that is; I’m making that copy up. (I wish I knew what it was; I could make a fortune!)

Just make sure you actually have the “single most” whatever-it-is you’re touting. This is an effective way to talk about it. I guarantee if your product is the superior product in its category, you’ll have the opportunity to use at least three or four “single most” bullets within your overall copy.

Give some very careful thought to this. It is a very powerful bullet technique if you don’t overuse it.

## How-To

This is a simple and very direct approach to writing a bullet. It’s the most common type of bullet, and there’s a reason why. It’s easy to write, and it’s effective, as long as you’re a little more creative than the next copywriter is.

Here’s what I mean. If you are writing copy for a product that is all about how to grow bigger, better, and more beautiful roses in your garden, you don’t want to write a bullet that says, “How to grow better roses.” You want a bullet that uses specificity to dimensionalize the benefit you’re claiming.

What do I mean by “dimensionalize”? Make it three dimensional. Make it real. Saying “Grow more and better roses” isn’t a dimensional statement. However, saying “How to grow rose bushes that are literally bursting with mounds of fragrant, colorful, beautiful blooms, with less effort and in less time” dimensionalizes that particular benefit bullet.

Any time you use the how-to bullet, make sure you’re using a few more specifics and make it more real, more tangible to the reader.

## Number

Use this when you have a specific number of techniques or multiple ways of doing a certain thing, multiple reasons why, or multiple reasons why not. Again, this is where you can combine a bullet with other kinds of bullets. You can combine the number bullet with the how-to bullet by simply saying, “Three ways to reduce your heating bill without making you or your family uncomfortable with the temperature of your house.”

You’re combining a number bullet with a how-to bullet. That’s a great way to dimensionalize the how-to bullet. Another way to combine the number bullet with a different type of bullet is to go one step back and look at the “single most” bullet. You could simply say, “The three ways to get 10% better gas mileage from any vehicle with a simple adjustment you can make with a screwdriver.”

## Sneaky

You’ve seen this one. You want to use it when you can imply some kind of element of conspiracy. Be careful you don’t overuse it, though.

So, what does the sneaky bullet look? Well, it would be something as easy and simple as “The sneaky methods drug companies use to keep you hooked on their products,” “Three sneaky tricks used by furnace repairmen to drive up the cost of your maintenance,” or “The one sneaky trick almost every auto mechanic uses to inflate your bill and how to avoid being suckered.”

This is most effective when you can confirm a suspicion that your reader already has. If you can do so, he or she will immediately be inclined to side with you, because we all love it when other people throw rocks at our enemies and confirm our suspicions. We like being proven right.

## Better Than

This is a great way to get your reader’s attention. You want to find something good that you can make better. For instance, if you discovered a way to lose weight that was better than the Atkins Diet, you could say, “Better than Atkins.”

Be ready to back that up, however. Especially in the health care field, you really have to be careful about complying with federal regulations when making any claims at all.

Consider this a word of caution about using this particular bullet with nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, exercise, and any other health-related products. Make sure you’re following the rules of compliance with the FTC, the FDA, and any of the other “alphabet agencies.”

Let’s use a different example. You have a method of doing follow-up marketing that is superior to using e-mail autoresponders. This method of yours nets 100 percent deliverability of your follow-up messages.

Now, each of us knows that e-mail is far from being 100 percent delivered. There are estimates ranging anywhere from 15 to over 50 percent of e-mails not delivered to their intended recipient. This isn’t spam we’re talking about; this is e-mail that people want to receive.

If you could guarantee 100 percent deliverability, you would be able to boldly claim, “Better than e-mail!” Often an effective way to use the “better than” bullet is to simply use a colon. So you might say something like, “Better than e-mail: 100% delivery of your follow-up messages guaranteed!”

## Simple Fact

When you can’t use a blind bullet, use simple facts—but make them interesting. You want to present worst case scenarios to set these particular kinds of bullets up.

For instance, in the health care field there was a study that came out not too long ago that showed people with healthy arteries are susceptible to sudden death because of plaque within their arteries, even though they may not have hardening of the arteries, or arteriosclerosis.

Even without a blockage, inflammation within their arteries might cause little pieces of plaque to break off and suddenly block the artery and kill them.

A simple fact bullet, using that information, might say something like, “Healthy people are dying of sudden cardiac arrest,” quote the study, then follow up with a comma and say something to this effect: “There are steps you can take to prevent this from happening.”

That’s a simple fact bullet. It’s not much of a blind bullet, but by presenting that simple fact, you can help reinforce the value, and the curiosity factor.

## What

I love these bullets because they’re the easiest to use. It’s a variation of the how-to bullet. The “what” bullet simply answers the question “What?” “What inoculations you need to travel abroad.” “What you should avoid touching when you check into a hotel room.” “What to do when you’re audited by the IRS.”

Can you see how easy it is to construct “what” bullets? These bullets are the easiest for you to write.

## What NEVER

This is the negative form of the “what” bullet. Notice how it frequently plays on the fear factor.

• What never to eat on an airplane (unless you want to die).

• What never to do immediately after exercising (if you want to avoid having a heart attack).

• What never to do on a first date (if you want him to ever call you back).

You simply start by stating what one should never do, and then you follow that up with the possible consequences of the reader ignoring this brilliant “what never” advice.

## Do You?

Use this particular kind of bullet when you believe your readers are doing something that is a mistake. Something that your product, service, or information will help them avoid.

“Do you make these mistakes when filling out your business tax returns?” Then you can use this as a two-step bullet by putting a parenthetical statement after that which says, “If you do, get ready to be audited — and you’d better have your records in order!”

## Reason Why

It’s a simple version of “reason why” copy. “Reason why” copy is a concept that is not often used, but should be. It’s just explaining the reasons why they should buy your product or service. Why is your offer superior to another company’s offer? Why should they buy now? Why should they buy from you?

“Reason why” is powerful advertising copy, and the “reason why” bullet is copy that hides the reason why.

A good example of “reason why” bullet point copy would be:

• The reason why you should always use the lowest octane fuel available at the gas pump, not the highest.

That arouses my curiosity. What is the reason behind that?

## Secrets Of

If you have an unusual solution, device, tactic, or method, then you can use this bullet to build curiosity. This is another bullet you need to use with care. Overuse can erode your credibility.

If you do know secrets, then using this kind of bullet sparingly helps fuel the fire of curiosity and can be a powerful addition to the bullets that you’re using in your copy.

## Probing Question

Ask a question you are reasonably certain you know the answer to. This is somewhat similar to number eighteen, but eighteen is targeting the readers directly on something that you’re pretty sure you know about them personally—either that they’re making a certain mistake; that they’re engaging in a certain behavior; or they have a certain problem.

This bullet isn’t necessarily directed at a mistake they’re making or behavior they’re engaging in. It can simply be a question about whether, for instance, they have a specific kind of knowledge.

• Do you know the seven kinds of deductions the IRS looks for to flag your return for an audit?

• Do you know the three tricks to use at closing to save tens of thousands of dollars on your real estate transactions?

• Do you know the 21 kinds of bullets you can use in your copy that will make it stand superior to other copy and close more sales?
