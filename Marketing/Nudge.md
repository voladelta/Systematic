## What’s in a Nudge?

Nudges are tiny changes to the environment that help you make better choices. They are micro-modifications in design to the “choice architecture”. In other words, nudges modify the information you have in front of you in order to make choosing feel more natural.

Nudges should come across as an encouraging voice. Helping us achieve our goals and make choices through positive reinforcement.

Nudges are not forceful.

They DON’T SHOUT.

Nudges can only be nudges if they are low-cost and non-intrusive.

**Nudge theory looks for long-term, steady changes, rather than try to force a direct behavioral change.**

BJ Fogg’s behavior model (FBM) proposes that successful behavioral change can only work if an individual is **able** to complete the task, is **motivated** to do so, and there is a **prompt** to cue initiating the behavior. B=MAP

**Nudges** are shaped by cognitive [[Biases]]. They make being human easier by influencing behavior through automatic modes of thinking. They work because they don’t engage our reflective thinking (which takes longer - humans are also incredibly lazy).

Nudges predict errors and reinforce quick decision-making. They take advantage of our heuristics (mental shortcuts) that help us act fast, find meaning, understand information, and remember things better.

To recap this quick lesson in consumer
behavior…
- **FBM**: Nudges are prompts that capitalize on the exact point of behavior where customers have high ability and high motivation.
- **System I**: Nudges are subtle changes to the choice architecture that help consumers make decisions by automatically tapping into the unconscious parts of our brains.
- **Cognitive biases**: Nudges respond to and help correct our innate and subconscious biases from System I.

Because of the research and psychology behind these small behavioral cues, and their low cost compared to relative impact, they have become fashionable in changing behavior. 

## Examples
1. Product badges 
Product badges are nudges that do two important things:
- Draw users attention to a product;
- Reveal something about the product that appeals to the user.

2. Smart notifications and overlays 
Smart notifications and interactive overlays are strong nudges since they provide a variety of information, such as:
- Showing new product lines;
- Branding information;
- Conveying messages about a product to make it more attractive;
- Showing discounts/offers;
- Encouraging sign-ups/registration.

3. Anchoring in ads
> Anchoring works because we use existing information as a baseline for our new judgments and decisions.

4. Increasing autonomy
When users feel like they’re in control of their online journey, it lends more credibility to your offers and products. 

For example, product recommendations curate an assortment of products that the customer can then choose from, giving consumers self-determination. Things like:
- “Top Picks for You”;
- “You Might Also Like”;
- “Your Favorites.”

5. Reviews
Reviews are nudges that change the choice architecture by revealing more information about a product, website, or business.

Framed in the context of word-of-mouth, reviews leverage social proof and are thus a powerful method of driving behavior:
- 93% of consumers say online reviews impact their decision-making.
- People trust their peers more than organizations.
- 41% of users read online reviews before purchasing a product.
- 50+ reviews on a product will lead to an average revenue increase of 4.6%.
- Social proof is even more influential than low prices.

6. Default options
Since defaults do not require any effort by the decision-maker, defaults can be a simple but powerful tool when there is inaction.

Default options:
- Alleviate decision stress and choice overload by choosing for the customer;
- Make decisions easier for the user/shopper, countering inertia;
- Make decisions easier for customers who rely on the expertise of the company to guide them;
- Streamline the customer journey.

7. Trust symbols
Trust symbols are nudges that enhance brand and website credibility. Placed at checkout in ecommerce, they guarantee credit card safety, data privacy, and are conventional safety nets to put your customers at ease. 

Other ways to increase trust with nudges are:
- Establishing third-party security guarantees;
- Fast shipping;
- An error-free UX;
- No extra costs at checkout;
- No hidden defaults (like newsletter subscriptions)
