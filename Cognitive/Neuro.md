[The Brain Maps Out Ideas and Memories Like Spaces](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/)
- The brain encodes abstract knowledge in the same way that it represents positions in space, which hints at a more universal theory of cognition.
- As the philosopher Immanuel Kant put it, the concept of space serves as the organizing principle by which we perceive and interpret the world, even in abstract ways. “Our language is riddled with spatial metaphors for reasoning, and for memory in general,” said Kim Stachenfeld.

[To Remember, the Brain Must Actively Forget](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-remember-the-brain-must-actively-forget-20180724/)
- Researchers find evidence that neural systems actively remove memories, which suggests that forgetting may be the default mode of the brain.
- Forgetting serves as a filter. It filters out the stuff that the brain deems unimportant.

[How the Brain Links Gestures, Perception and Meaning](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-links-gestures-perception-and-meaning-20190325/)
- Neuroscience has found that gestures are not merely important as tools of expression but as guides of cognition and perception.

[The Neuroscience Behind Bad Decision](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-neuroscience-behind-bad-decisions-20160823/)
- Irrationality may be a consequence of the brain’s ravenous energy needs.
- Glimcher said that his research has helped him develop specific strategies. “Rather than pick what I hope is the best, instead I now always start by eliminating the worst element from a choice set,” he said, reducing the number of options to something manageable, like three. “I find that this really works, and it derives from our study of the math. Sometimes you learn something simple from the most complex stuff, and it really can improve your decision-making.”

[To Make Sense of the Present, Brains May Predict the Future](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-sense-of-the-present-brains-may-predict-the-future-20180710/)
- Predictive coding theory suggests that perception, motor control, memory and other brain functions all depend on comparisons between ongoing actual experiences and the brain’s modeled expectations.

[Brains Speed Up Perception by Guessing What’s Next](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-speed-up-perception-by-guessing-whats-next-20190502/)
- Your expectations shape and quicken your perceptions. A new model that explains the effect suggests it’s time to update theories about sensory processing.
- Decision making isn’t a gradual process driven by the buildup of information at all, but rather a sort of “aha” moment, a jump in neural fluctuations.

[To Pay Attention, the Brain Uses Filters, Not a Spotlight](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-pay-attention-the-brain-uses-filters-not-a-spotlight-20190924/)
- A brain circuit that suppresses distracting sensory information holds important clues about attention and other cognitive processes.
- Attention is really about sequencing from this to that in the correct order and making sure you don’t get distracted by things you shouldn’t be distracted by. The notion that motor structures are involved in this … is appropriate, in a way — that they should be right at the heart of the process of deciding what you will attend to next, what you will focus your sensory resources on next.

[Your Brain Chooses What to Let You See](https://www.quantamagazine.org/your-brain-chooses-what-to-let-you-see-20190930/)
- Beneath our awareness, the brain lets certain kinds of stimuli automatically capture our attention by lowering the priority of the rest.
- It gets rid of information that’s distracting or less useful in order to make the more relevant inputs stand out.
