## consuming
20 percent principle: by spending 20 percent of your waking hours consuming material in your creative field, you can develop an intuitive, expert-level understanding of the level of familiarity of an idea—where it lies on the creative curve—even without real-world experience.

The reason the 20 percent principle is that it provides the building blocks that are necessary for aha moments to flourish. This accumulation of prior knowledge fills up the brain with examples and concepts that artists then use to uncover non-obvious insights.

Bowden explained the importance of establishing prior knowledge. “I think one of the problems people have with the idea of insight is if they think it’s a magical process, they think that they shouldn’t have to work hard to have an insight; but what you need to do is you have to establish a certain level of knowledge. **You can’t have insights about things you don’t know anything about.**”

## creative community / clustering
- a master teacher
	- They teach constraints, and they assist with deliberate practice through feedback. Absorbing these constraints in turn allows students to make progress more rapidly, as they refine their own skills.
- a conflicting collaborator
	- Basically, you don’t want to collaborate with someone who is so easy to get along with that they don’t push you. The goal is to find a person who will help you discover and overcome your flaws.
	- Ideal collaborators balance out each other’s weaknesses and provide different perspectives. 
- a modern muse
	- an individual or a group of people who continually inspire and motivate you. 
	- finding a support system that gets you through these rough spots will restore your energy and optimism, and make you that much more likely to achieve world-class success. 
	- sometimes the best inspiration comes from friendly competition.
- a prominent promoter
	- someone with credibility who is willing to advocate for you and your work

## iterating / experimenting
- conceptualization
	- where creatives generate a set of plausible ideas
- reduction
	- the sweet spot of the creative curve is by putting their work before an audience early and often
	- To create ideas that stick, you need to go from a wide-ranging list of plausible ideas to a data-driven subset of ideas that have strong consumer and audience indicators
	- Your goal is to constantly refine your understanding of where an idea will fall on the creative curve
- curation
	- when you rely on people, either internally or externally, to give you qualitative perspectives
- feedback
	- where creators can gauge if they were in the creative curve’s sweet spot
