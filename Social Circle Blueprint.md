This plan includes a series of questions aimed at identifying the underlying drives, choices, and motivations of your social upbringing. There are five distinct categories, including family, friends, game, lifestyle, and career, each with a set of questions to help you design your future social life.

Let's begin with Family. As a child, your family plays a pivotal role in shaping your social norms and desires. Understanding your family dynamics is crucial to understanding how your mindset works today. Please answer the following questions in your journal:

• Who did you crave love from more while growing up - your mother or father?

• What is your social relationship like with your father?

• What was your social relationship like with your mother?

• What circumstances led you to be social around your family?

• With whom were you most social within your family?

• Who in your family treated you with the most respect?

• Who in your family offended you the most?

Next, let's move on to Friends. During your teenage years, the influence of your nuclear family diminishes, and personal friendships become increasingly significant. Answer the following questions in your journal:

• What was the pivotal friendship you had as a child, and what made that bond strong?

• What was the pivotal friendship you had as a teenager, and what made that bond strong?

• Can you provide an example of a friendship in which you felt slighted?

• Can you provide an example of a friendship that faltered due to your shortcomings?

• When did you feel included amongst your peers?

• When did you feel ostracized by your peers?

• What was your role amongst your peer group, such as the class clown, the leader, or the social butterfly?

• What do you look for in a friend now?

Moving on to Game and Social Life, our assumptions and habits regarding relationships with women are often formed during high school and college years. Answer the following questions in your journal:

• What was your approach to dating like in high school? Were you popular or isolated? Confident or scared to interact with girls? Did you make the first move or were you always hoping something would happen?

• What was your best game moment in high school, such as your first kiss or hook-up?

• What was your lowest game moment in high school?

• With your current understanding of game, what factors led to success, such as social proof, pre-selection, or throwing parties?

• If you could go back to high school or college, what would you do differently in terms of game?

• Why are you interested in game now?

• What is your ultimate goal?

- How will you know when you've achieved it?
    

Lifestyle development is a core part of this Social Circle Blueprint . But before we can define the lifestyle we want, we have to delve deep into the lifestyle choices we’ve made and most importantly – why we made them. Journal your answers below.

• Are you living the lifestyle up until now, that you’ve always wanted? If not, what has been missing?

• What have been the 3 most epic experiences of your life?

• What was the one place that you loved traveling to the most growing up and why?

• What is the one place you’ve never been that you want to travel to now and why?

• What “superficial possession” did you always want growing up, e.g., a car, house, watch or clothes?

 • What are the factors that make an experience “epic” for you, e.g., an amazing location, specific people, women, money, food, and unique activities?

- What element of your social life are you most grateful for now? Why?
    

**CAREER**

Now we turn our attention to your career. Career choices have major a impact on your social and sex life, yet so many people fail to see that connection. In order to define the relationship you want between your career and social life, we designed these key questions to help craft a synergistic vision for that relationship. Journal your answers below.

• What are the activities you love doing that cause you to lose track of time?

• What role does work play in the life and lifestyle that you want?

• What career related opportunities excite you the most and why?

• What are you willing to give up to develop the ultimate financial and social lifestyle you want?

- What potential career tweaks or changes could you make to create a more synergic lifestyle socially and financially?
    

**ACTION PLAN**

Now we’re going to walk you through setting up your Internal SCB Roadmap.

I want you to review all the answers and insights that have come up in this process, and list your 3 core social values, i.e, what is it that you value you most in your social life. Is it simply having hot

women, access to incredible night life, the friendship of high status males, traveling opportunities? Based off the the self inventory we’ve conducted together I want you to narrow your social values into a top three – and then list them in order of importance

Now you have purpose and boundaries. As you work through each action plan, implement and execute the ideas in SCB  you have an internal big picture vision for the work that you are putting in. Every action you take, whether it’s Instagram reconnaissance, number closing potential female friends or throwing your own container events – it’s all linked to your core values and supported by them. Simultaneously, you’ve set a personal boundary of behaviors and mindsets you are no longer willing to accept in yourself.

Everyday you live according to your values and boundaries you are developing the ultimate lifestyle you’ve always wanted and deserve.

This blueprint emphasizes lifestyle development as a core component. However, before defining the lifestyle we desire, we need to examine the choices we've made and why we've made them. The following questions should be journaled to aid in this process:

**LIFESTYLE:**

- Have you been living the lifestyle you've always wanted up until now? If not, what has been lacking?
    
- What have been the three most extraordinary experiences of your life?
    
- What was your favorite travel destination growing up, and why?
    
- What is one place you haven't been to yet that you would like to travel to now, and why?
    
- What material possession did you always want growing up?
    
- What factors make an experience "epic" for you?
    
- What aspect of your social life are you most thankful for, and why?
    

**CAREER:**

- What activities do you enjoy doing that make you lose track of time?
    
- How does work fit into the life and lifestyle you want?
    
- What career opportunities are you most excited about, and why?
    
- What are you willing to sacrifice to achieve the ultimate financial and social lifestyle you desire?
    
- Does your current career path allow you to interact with the type of women and high-status men you want?
    
- What career changes could you make to create a more synergistic lifestyle socially and financially?
    

**ACTION PLAN:**

To set up your Internal SCB Roadmap, review all of your answers and insights, and identify your top three social values. These are the things you value the most in your social life, such as hot women, incredible nightlife, high-status male friendships, or travel opportunities. Then, rank these social values in order of importance.

Next, review your answers again and identify the top three social values or states that have caused you the most dissatisfaction, frustration, and unhappiness. These might include fear, scarcity, lack of true friendships, or toxic relationships.

Finally, with purpose and boundaries in place, implement and execute the ideas in this blueprint. Each action you take should be linked to your core values and supported by them. As you live according to your values and boundaries, you are creating the ultimate lifestyle you deserve.

Welcome to the Define Your Life Action Plan, where I will guide you through the process of creating a clear vision for your social life, including the type of women, relationships, friendships, travel, and leisure activities you want. This step-by-step guide will help you create an inspiring vision board for your life.

Women:

Let's start by defining the physical and personality traits you want in the women in your life. Define the top three physical traits and personality traits that are important to you, and find five examples of women on Instagram who embody those traits. Consider the different roles that women can play in your life, such as short-term flings, long-term relationships, and female friends who can introduce you to other women.

Men:

Define the characteristics you want in your male relationships, including high-status males and confidants. High-status males can provide access to desirable social circles, while confidants are trusted friends who understand your goals and vision.

Location:

Choose the ideal location for you to live based on your goals, including proximity to hot women, business networking opportunities, and a comfortable, inspiring environment. Look for images on Instagram that represent the kind of place you want to live in and its location.

Weekly Schedule:

Create a weekly schedule that includes day venues for each day of the week, such as day clubs, bars, brunch locations, and happy hour spots. This will help you be intentional about your social life and create opportunities to meet new people.

By the end of this action plan, you will have a clear vision for your social life and a vision board to help you stay focused on your goals. Good luck!

In the third module, "Cultivate your Environment: Social Media Reconnaissance," I will guide you through various techniques and resources to help you discover the right people and places in your city to build the social circle you desire. Before we delve into the reconnaissance strategies, let's organize your existing social circle to identify the specific roles you need to fill. These roles include identifying your top three female friends and pivots, high-status male friends, male confidant, nightlife hosts and promoters, nightlife management, nightlife service professionals, and photographers and videographers.

Moving on to Instagram reconnaissance, refer to your weekly venue calendar and identify three people from each venue, including the owner/manager, promoter/host, and a nightlife server. The reconnaissance method begins with approaching and opening women and asking them where they eat before going out to the clubs. This will help you identify the select restaurants that the hottest girls in your city frequent. Once you have identified these restaurants, look them up on Instagram and find hot girls and industry staff who post pictures there.

Next, jump into their individual Instagram pages and look for the nightclubs they frequent, restaurants they eat at, hot girls they associate with, and industry staff they know. Also, pay attention to the tagged locations and people in their stories. You can also use techniques such as check-ins and comments to obtain valuable information. Remember, the main principle at work here is to identify the fickle 500, i.e., the hottest and most connected girls, best and recurring venues, and industry professionals in your city.

This passage provides tips and tactics for building social connections through exchanging contact information and creating future projections. The first step is to understand a person's PDE (Primary Driver Emotion), identify shared commonalities, then use that information to create a compelling future projection. The more specific the details, the better. The final element is to ensure excitement and investment from the person you're interacting with, as this will solidify the connection. The passage also includes bonus email examples to gain access to nightclubs and photography tips for putting on your own photo shoots. It suggests identifying photographers in your social circle who may be interested in working for free, determining their PDE, and understanding their photography specialty.

**Introduction:**

When building your social circle, you will likely encounter photographers at events and nightclubs. These are valuable networking opportunities where you can discuss photography, learn about their specific style and shoots, and even plan future projects. You can also find local photographers through the reconnaissance strategy by reviewing their work and finding those who are a good fit for your projects.

**Models:**

You can find models for your photo shoots by using the power of photography game. Ask every girl if they have modeled before or if they are interested in modeling. Strengthen the commonality, future project a photo shoot, and exchange contact information. You can also coordinate with established photographers who already have a network of models, or use the reconnaissance strategy on Instagram to find models that fit the scale and quality of your photo shoots.

**Location:**

Finding an exquisite location for your photo shoot can be challenging, but it is an important element to consider. Look for locations with a great view, unique interior or exterior components, and an overall high status or wealth indicators. When brainstorming locations, consider the scenery, space, unique backgrounds, props, and designs that can add value to your photo shoot.

Acquiring Locations:

Connecting with high-status males through table game and frequenting high-end restaurants can be a great way to acquire locations. You can also tap your network of photographers, as they can introduce you to people who have access to various locations. Adding a makeup artist to your team can also add a level of professionalism to your photo shoot and provide extra value to everyone involved.

Bonus 1: Makeup Artist

Aspiring makeup artists are willing to work for free to gain experience and build their own network. You can find them on Instagram or pull from your own social circle to add value to your photo shoot.

Bonus 2: Creating a Photography IG Profile

Creating a photography Instagram profile can facilitate networking with photographers, models, and people who can give you access to locations. It can be a great way to showcase your work and attract potential collaborators.

Strengthen your networking with individuals who have access to amazing locations by showcasing your access to models and photographers. Additionally, having an Instagram page that displays your photo shoots can greatly enhance your relationships with the women you interact with regularly. Holding a photo shoot is a highly effective event, and a dedicated Instagram page serves as both proof of its authenticity and excellent advertising for future shoots.

The travel-based events and annual container events that we teach will offer some of the most unforgettable experiences of your life. Of all the SCB events we offer, your annual travel events will create some of the most remarkable memories you'll ever have. In this section, I'll guide you through all the necessary elements you need to successfully plan and execute your own travel events.

The key strategy to successfully organize these events is value arbitrage. If you try to take on all aspects of planning an event by yourself, you'll quickly become overwhelmed with the logistical and financial requirements. There are two core approaches to setting up travel events without bearing the entire responsibility of planning everything: piggybacking on established events and organizing your own.

Piggybacking on Established Events:

Many companies organize and host international model shoots and events worldwide. For example, events like Paradise Challenge and Karma occur annually, bringing together photographers and models in exotic locations like Jamaica and Ibiza. To piggyback on these established events, start by identifying the companies that host the international events you want to attend. Then, use Instagram to conduct reconnaissance and identify two components: the people responsible for organizing the events and their PDE. If you can fulfill their PDE, which is often one of the essential event components that we'll cover in the next section, you can offer value to the event runners. For example, for most international photo shoots, the most important commodity needed is models. However, access to videographers, photographers, and housing can also fulfill potential PDEs for these events.

To piggyback on established events, follow these steps:

1. Determine the international events you want to attend.
    
2. Research the companies responsible for organizing the events and their PDE.
    
3. Ask yourself, "can I offer value for any of the event PDEs?"
    
4. If you can't fulfill any of the PDEs, ask yourself "how can I expand my social circle to eventually fulfill an event PDE?”
    

Organizing your Own:

Before planning your own travel event, it's essential to define its core goals and purpose. Is it to explore a city, town, or country you've always wanted to visit? Is it to close the hottest girl you've ever closed? Is it to bring together as many hot girls and high-status males as possible to expand your social circle? Take some time to clearly define the top two reasons you want to organize this specific traveling event.

To plan your own travel event, start by defining where you want to go and, most importantly, the people you want to invite. Since planning such an event requires your time, effort, and money, it's crucial to clearly define the people you want to spend that time and effort on. Next, set the date for the trip and begin the recruitment process. When reaching out to potential attendees, establish your USP, or unique selling point. What makes women want to attend this trip? What would make high-status males want to join? Is it an amazing photography opportunity? An exotic location? A beautiful villa or mansion? Clearly define the unique selling point of your event.

As you go through the recruitment process, develop a promotional invitation. This can be as simple as a flyer, or you can use footage from last year's event if it's not the first time you're organizing this trip. Make sure the flyer and/or video promotes the USP of the event.

While recruiting, look for "key connectors." These are people who have networks of models and hot women. By getting a key connector on board, they will then invite many people in their network to your event without you having to contact them individually. These key connectors can be industry professionals like promoters or other high-status males with social circles that include many female friends

In this section, I will guide you through the six categories of openers, provide you with examples of each, suggest the best situations to use them in, and give you drills to practice and improve your opening skills. Let's begin.

The functional opener is the most straightforward and effective opener, and although it may seem mundane, it can still serve its purpose. For instance, you can use the following example: "Excuse me, do you know what time the club closes?" This opener is a low-risk/low-reward one and best used by beginners, early in the night, as part of a warm-up, or when you first enter into a venue.

To practice functional openers, you should follow these steps:

1. Enter the venue and walk from one end to the next.
    
2. Use ten functional openers as you walk. Keep them simple, asking where the bar is, the bathroom, or the closing time of the club.
    
3. Stay in each interaction a little longer than the previous one. If they respond well, ask a qualifying question, such as where they are from, and then break rapport.
    

The observational opener utilizes anything in the environment or the shared experience between you and the girl to start the conversation. For instance, you can use the following example: "Damn, did you turn up the AC in here? It's freezing. Is that you?" This opener can create an inside joke together or a mini conspiracy theory, and it's best used when standing in line for a drink, standing in proximity to an occurrence in the environment, or anytime a significant change takes place in your environment.

The compliment opener is an excellent choice for most settings and builds the right amount of comfort to allow for breaks in rapport. For example, you can use the following opener: "Those eyebrows are on fleek!" This opener rewards her for something she's worked for or attained and is best used as a default opener.

To practice compliment openers, you should follow these steps:

1. Walk through the venue.
    
2. Open each girl that passes with a compliment opener and end it by saying, "Have a good night" or "Keep it up."
    
3. Do not stay in set. Deliver the compliment opener and continue walking as long as she hears it.
    
4. Complete ten at a time until you hit 50 opens.
    

The introduction opener involves having the peer group of the girl you want to talk to introduce you to her. You achieve this by opening and gaming her peer group and then asking them to introduce the two of you. For example, you can use the following opener: "Introduce me to your friend." This opener is the best in your arsenal as it gives you initial comfort via the introduction and is best used when gaming at tables, gaming in high-value areas, gaming in intimate lounges, or when you've already opened members of her peer group.

To practice introduction openers, you should follow these steps:

1. Open a group set.
    
2. After the initial open and breaks in rapport, ask the girl you're in a conversation with to introduce you to someone in her peer group by saying, "Introduce me to your friend."
    
3. Repeat for a total of ten sets.
    

The direct opener is a high-risk/high-reward opener that you should not use in a social circle setting or high-status area. For example, you can use the following opener: "You're sexy as fuck. What's your name?" This opener puts a lot of pressure on the girl, forcing her to make a decision, and has a higher rejection rate. However, if the decision she makes about you is favorable, you will have hooked the set right off the open.

Here's a drill for direct openers:

Step 1: Begin with "What's your name? You're adorable."

Step 2: Repeat the opener ten times.

Step 3: As you become more comfortable and your confidence increases, focus on your tonality. Move away from a neutral tone and adopt a more assertive and challenging tone that exudes authority.

Another classic opener is the opinion opener. This involves asking the girl her preference or opinion on a particular topic. For example, you could ask, "Do you prefer hip hop or electronic music?"

While opinion openers can be effective conversation starters, they work best as a transitional tool to move into open-ended conversations. They are particularly useful in warm social settings.

Building Connections through Commonalities

In this discussion, we will explore the techniques involved in establishing commonalities with women and girls in the context of developing your social skills. We will cover the importance of commonalities, ways to build them, and different categories of commonalities that you can use in your interactions.

The Significance of Commonalities

When learning social skills, people tend to focus solely on building attraction, assuming it to be the ultimate way to "hook" a set. However, attraction is simply a tool used to spark investment, which is the lifeblood of social interactions. Attraction changes constantly from moment to moment, while investment is substantive and the most powerful way to get compliance. Obtaining investment and creating a connection is the way to really "hook" a set, and one of the key methods to developing a connection is through the use of commonalities.

**Methods to Build Commonalities**

The first step in building commonalities is to ask qualifying questions. You can use different categories of commonalities, such as geography or people, to come up with qualifying questions. Once a commonality arises, you acknowledge and reward it. Commonalities do not need to be deep, spiritual, or life-changing; hitting on multiple commonalities is much more important than the depth of a single commonality. Being specific with the commonality fosters a stronger connection. Instead of concerning yourself with the depth of a commonality, focus on its specificity.

Qualifying the girl or teasing her regarding the commonality that you're building is a prerequisite to sharing your own experience. Commonality stacking is the process of building one commonality after the next. Future projections can be leveraged into a future projection, strengthening the connection and encouraging compliance.

Categories of Commonalities

Here are six different categories to help build commonalities:

1. **Geography:** encompasses places she's traveled or wants to travel to, where she's lived, colleges she's attended or is attending, etc.
    
2. **People**: looking for mutual acquaintances.
    
3. **Activities**: mutual interests or activities that you both enjoy, such as dancing or hiking.
    
4. **Experiences**: common experiences that you've both had, such as studying abroad or playing sports.
    
5. **Goals**: future goals that you both have, such as learning a new language or traveling.
    
6. **Values**: shared values, such as being environmentally conscious or prioritizing family.
    

By asking qualifying questions in these categories, you can effectively build commonalities and create connections with women and girls.

Here are the 3 types of energy you are going to be dealing with and you need to match their energy

1.The energizer bunny: Very high energy person full of passion

2.The accountant, very practical, business

3.The lover- loves everyone and everything

Mirroring people isn't a commonality but it can help them like you more

This will get them invested more and they will subconsciously want to build more commonalities and get to know you better

Don't forget to mirror often

In this section of the action plan, you will learn about two important concepts in social circle building, **social proof** and **pre-selection**. Social proof is a method of gaining status within an environment by people knowing you and liking you, which results in contextual popularity and positive attention. Pre-selection, on the other hand, is the most powerful attraction trigger for women, where multiple women finding a man attractive leads other women to find that man attractive as well.

To build social proof, you need to build a base set, engage with the regulars, and befriend the staff. You can also build social proof long-term by building commonalities with everyone you meet, combining commonalities with future projections, and using geography as a hook point.

To build pre-selection, you should disqualify and friend-zone every girl you meet, approach all girl groups, and utilize Instagram to showcase that you are with women. Call girls sister and bestie. You should always close two forms of contact, such as Instagram and phone number, and time bridge to the next time you will see them. By implementing these strategies, you can have a powerful social circle and abundance of hot girls.

Having a diverse group of female friends can greatly benefit your dating life. Instead of solely pursuing romantic relationships, it's important to establish platonic relationships with women as well. Friend-zoning girls can create a sense of comfort and trust, which can eventually lead to attraction.

It's helpful to have different categories of female friends in your life. For example, there are female friends that you may hook up with, those that can introduce you to potential partners, friends who can enhance your social status by going out with you, acquaintances you see occasionally, and even women you engage in threesomes with.

This section will focus on the strategies to approach someone in a social circle setting. The article covers the concept of attraction equity and explains the difference between the methods of attaining attraction in cold approach and social circle settings. Pre-selection and social proof are powerful tools to build attraction in a social circle setting, and your environment can help you by cultivating it to create the highest attraction triggers. The article also highlights behaviors and game tactics that you should avoid in a social circle setting, including physical game, aggressive breaks in rapport, and sexual escalation. Instead, the focus should shift towards qualification and logistics, building comfort, breaking rapport, qualifying, and aligning logistics to close.

When you approach someone in a social circle setting, it is crucial to understand their motives and objectives in that environment. Women are generally interested in having fun and increasing their status, which can be achieved by sharing good emotions and pumping buying temperature. Therefore, it is essential to cultivate and control your environment to provide a fun and status-enhancing experience.

The article then outlines a game formula of build comfort, break rapport, qualify, and reward or deeper punish qualification, which can be used in any setting, including cold approach and social circle. When you approach someone in a social circle setting, you need to open in a way that builds comfort first, using complimentary, observational, functional, and introductory-style opening. Then, break the comfort in a way that sparks a baseline level of attraction, but avoid aggressive breaks in rapport. Instead, focus on playful banter, teasing, and disqualifying statements. Finally, qualification and logistics are crucial to gain real investment and align the logistics to allow for the close.

Progressive Qualification:

1. As you progress through the cycle of qualification, each question should delve deeper into the person's psyche. Initially, you ask simple and surface-level qualifying questions, but with each new question, you aim to probe further and obtain greater investment. Questions such as "If you could fly anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?" or "What drew you to your career?" or "What's the wildest experience you've had while traveling?" serve as starters. As the cycle continues, the questions should become deeper and more intimate until the person shares aspects of their life that they seldom reveal to anyone.
    
2. The Significance of Logistics:
    
3. After establishing a cold approach foundation and understanding the role of the environment, the next component, which is arguably the most crucial, is logistics.
    
4. To close an interaction, you must be able to move it to a sex location. Your proficiency in handling logistics is the most significant factor in moving an interaction forward and ultimately closing it.
    
5. Remember, logistics trump game. If you live 30 minutes away from the nightclub, you will need to rely more on your game to pull and close. On the other hand, if you live across the street from the nightclub, you will pull and close more girls solely because of logistics.
    
6. This section will teach you how to:
    

- Elicit logistical information to move the interaction forward in the right direction
    
- Align your goals with her goals to invest in the pull
    
- Seed the pull
    
- Provide plausible deniability so that she does not feel judged.
    

In order to master logistics, the first step is to gather the necessary information to navigate the situation. For instance, pulling a girl who is attending a birthday party will differ from pulling a girl who is only hanging out with casual friends. Thus, acquiring basic logistical information is crucial to determine the approach. This can be done by asking the four logistical questions: who are you here with, what are you doing tomorrow, where are you staying, and what are you doing later tonight. These questions can be asked during the qualification cycle, and each question provides an opportunity to reward or tease the girl while also discovering the logistical information needed to pull.

It is important to align your goals with the woman's goals. Women do not necessarily share your goal for the night, which may be to get laid. Most women want to have fun and increase their status. You must create an environment that is non-judgmental and appropriate to close. Therefore, you need to structure the night in a way that fulfills her personal desire for the night while also leading to a suitable location for sex.

To effectively seed the pull, you need to combine the basic logistical information with her personal desire for the night. For instance, if you organize a container event where your group attends a nightclub and gets a comp table, you can determine that most women would want to have fun and increase their status without decreasing their status. Pulling the group for an after-party would allow for the fun to continue while also fulfilling their personal desire for the night. Seeding the pull can be done by asking an effective question like "Have you been invited to the after party?", which presupposes that the after-party has already been set up and creates a degree of fear of missing out. Additionally, you can start seeding the pull early by establishing that the after-party is simply the next part of the night and another part of the adventure.

It is essential to take into account group dynamics and not solely focus on seeding the pull with the girl you are interacting with. By establishing the relationships within the group, you can effectively ascertain how to proceed.

Discretion and plausible deniability are crucial for successful social circle game. In a social circle, a woman may face severe judgment for having casual sex, which can be magnified by the sensitivity of the situation. Therefore, it is essential to never brag or show off about sleeping with a girl in either your own or her social circle. Physical escalation should be avoided until you are in a sex location, and hooking up with girls in your mutual social circle should never be talked about. Plausible deniability can be created by making events appear to occur spontaneously, making a woman feel less judgment. Each logistical move should have a non-sexual justification, and fulfilling her purpose for the night is key. Attempting to isolate a girl from her group is risky as it can lead to judgment and the opposite of discretion. It is best to pull the entire group and wait for attrition to occur, where people start to fall off and close windows arise. The end goal of the night should be the sex location, which should be set up in advance with a justifiable reason to move there.

Welcome to the section of the PDF that discusses container events. Container events are an integral part of SCB and require the use of every element and component to obtain results. In this section, you will learn how to create container events, and you will also be provided with an example of a container event, tips on how to funnel women to your container events, and how to effectively market them to improve the attendance of future events.

Container events are important because they work as a mass group date that allows you to invite all the women in your funnel to a central group date, which maximizes efficiency. They also allow you to utilize social proof and pre-selection by creating a group date with high-status males and multiple women, which triggers social proof and pre-selection. Additionally, there is no obligation for any specific person to attend, so much of the pressure associated with a 1:1 date is removed. Lastly, unlike a 1:1 date, a container event is marketable because of the social proof and pre-selection present at the event, allowing you to market these events via Instagram and create more leads for future events.

To create a container event, you need to define the women and high-status males you want to invite. Some of these people will already be in your social circle, while others will be high-status males and industry professionals, and some will be women you’ve met throughout the week that you will funnel to this container event. You also need to define the event, which includes researching the most successful container events on Instagram and modeling them. Ask yourself questions such as where the women you want to attract are already going, which kind of events are most congruent to your goals, and when and where these events take place.

Once you have defined the people and event, you need to define the venue and the sequence of venues for the night. A container event should include a pre-party, a core venue, and an after-party. As you start planning your container event, always ask yourself, “where are the women that I want already going?” You need to model other successful container events and make strategic decisions about how the night starts, builds to a climax, and how you pull to a sex location.

The Container Event Principles entail two fundamental aspects that must be adhered to. Firstly, the events should be consistent and regular. Altering them frequently can undermine their efficacy. Although monthly events may feature variety, weekly ones must remain unchanged.

Secondly, it is essential to ensure that the container events demand minimal effort and time commitment. No attendee should feel obliged to participate. If women or individuals with high social status feel coerced, they are unlikely to attend. The objective is to make these events a regular occurrence without obligating anyone to attend every time.

Examples of Weekly Container Events:

- Complimentary bottled water at a nightclub
    
- Outing to a strip club
    
- Happy hour at a bar, lounge, or restaurant in the industry
    
- Complimentary dinner
    
- Sunday brunch
    
- Movie night
    

Monthly container events offer an opportunity to introduce variety, excitement, and complexity, but also require more planning and structure. They are unique because they are not routine and can change from one month to the next, providing a different selling point that sets them apart from weekly container events.

Examples of monthly container events include themed house parties (such as lingerie, all-white, or masquerade), photo shoots, multiple venue night outs, industry parties (such as Babes in Toyland or Karma Events), and strip club outings. It is important to ensure that monthly container events are different from the weekly events to keep things fresh.

To successfully market your container events, there are several strategies you can use, such as themed flyers and photography and video. Flyers are essential because they add a professional touch to your event and communicate logistical information, including the location, access, unique selling point, date, and time.

Photography and video are also crucial for documenting the event and generating social proof and pre-selection. Every container event sets up the next one, and capturing key moments and people on camera can create massive FOMO (fear of missing out) and generate interest and leads for future events. When taking photos and videos, it is important to focus on the people, use filters appropriately, and capture fun and memorable moments.

Instagram has revolutionized the way we approach event promotion, and container events are no exception. By utilizing Instagram effectively before, during, and after your event, you can maximize its impact. Here's how:

Before the event:

1. Create a flyer that includes all the key information about your event.
    
2. Share the flyer repeatedly on your Instagram story as you build up to the event.
    
3. Encourage all attendees to post the flyer on their own Instagram stories as well.
    
4. Share pictures and videos from your past events to promote the upcoming one.
    

During the event:

1. Focus on pre-selection and create videos with the girls attending your event. Use filters, tag them, and ask them to follow your Instagram account.
    
2. Taking pictures with high-status males is not as important, but any high-status males who provide social proof are worth taking pictures with.
    
3. Divide your photography and videography into two sections: individual and group. Spend time taking photos and videos with each girl individually, and then capture the group dynamic. Share the pictures and videos on your Instagram story.
    

After the event:

In addition to sharing pictures and videos on your Instagram story during the event, you can also:

1. Organize the photos from the event and send them to all attendees.
    
2. Post the best videos and photos from the night on your Instagram in the days following the event. This is a form of post-event marketing to create FOMO and buzz for the next event.
    

Finally, it's important to consider the in-person optics and behavior at your container event. The pre-game party is crucial for creating bonds among attendees and generating social proof. Check out the highlights section on @MichaelSartain for inspiration on how to create epic Instagram stories at your event.

At the main venue, let the environment work for you and utilize photos, videos, and Instagram as we discussed while maintaining a fun and lighthearted atmosphere. As the leader, you are responsible for monitoring alcohol and the behavior of the guys in your circle, and you must address any inappropriate behavior or remove guys who aren't part of your group if necessary.

During the after-party, it's essential to avoid being physically aggressive. As we've discussed earlier, after-parties provide isolation opportunities, and until you're in a suitable location, being physical isn't appropriate. Discretion and non-judgment are also crucial factors. All women at your after-party should be there for reasons that have nothing to do with sex. Additionally, it's essential to avoid putting women in positions of judgment, so you wait for isolation opportunities and never force isolation or engage in physical intimacy in front of their friends or peer group.

During the after-party, you should maintain a fun and lighthearted vibe while building comfort and waiting for appropriate isolation opportunities.

BONUS 1: Connecting with Cocktail Waitresses and Bus Boys

Tip #1: Tip generously. Industry professionals take care of each other. A generous tip is a sign that you know and value their work. It can build commonalities without ever having to say a word.

Tip #2: Acknowledge the bus boys. Many people don't even acknowledge their presence. Exchange names with them and thank them for their work.

Tip #3: Offer value. Many cocktail waitresses are required to bring in patrons. Build commonalities, find out their industry PDE, and offer value. If they respond positively, exchange contact information.

BONUS 2: Connecting with High-Status Males

Every night, you have opportunities to bond with high-status males at the nearby tables. Most guys will sit at their table and never think to game the surrounding tables. Anyone sitting at a table area is there because they have access or money, both of which can be of value to you.

Tip #1: Open up to the table owner or the friendliest guy at the table. Don't hit on the girls. Use lines like "what up table neighbor."

Tip #2: Ask qualifying questions, build commonalities, and offer value. Never ask for their alcohol. Instead, offer your own. Never ask for their girls; instead, introduce them to yours.

This is how you get invited to private parties where there is 0 table service in the wine room at a country club The restaurants, clubs, upscale bars are just starting points

1. In the previous modules, we discussed logistics in detail. In this section, the focus is on logistics as it relates to successfully inviting a girl to your place after a container event. Always keep in mind that logistics are more important than your “game," as it's easier for a girl to come back to your place if the logistics are favorable. Understanding the logistics of each girl at the container event can help you choose the most likely candidate to pull.
    
2. Making it easy for the girl to come home with you is key, and one way to do this is to have the container event as close as possible to your place, or better yet, have your place be the container event. Another way to make it easy for a girl to come to your place is to create a "Pleasure Bubble," where you have a collection of things that make your place an enjoyable and comfortable environment for her to be in.
    
3. In terms of attraction-building techniques, pre-selection is the most effective. However, in this section, we will focus on disqualification, which is a powerful verbal attraction-building technique that sets you apart from other men by communicating that you are not interested in the girl. It also causes her to qualify herself to you and elicits investment from her.
    
4. Disqualification is all about giving the girl reasons why you don't want her instead of trying to impress her. This makes her want to prove herself to you, and when done correctly, can lead to physical escalation. The goal is to create a challenging and playful dismissal that will make her defend herself in a good-natured way, thereby qualifying herself to you.
    
5. When it comes to social circle settings, the focus should be on building enough attraction to generate interest but not so much that you become the "player." Instead, the focus should be on building comfort and trust with the people in your social circle.
    

**Tips for Building Comfort and Choosing a Girl**

This section provides tips on how to build comfort with a girl, find commonalities, and choose a girl after hosting a container event.

To build comfort with a girl, it is important to have positive intentions and be value-adding during conversations. Pre-selection is also a powerful tool for generating attraction and comfort, and can be achieved by walking into a venue with other girls. Finding commonalities with a girl is also key to building rapport and maintaining connections. The easiest things to find commonalities with are location, career, and hobbies.

After hosting a container event, the goal is to identify the girl who shows the most interest and set up a post-container event with her. This should be something chill like dessert, drinks, movies, or a game night. The ultimate goal is to create a dating pipeline by pulling the girl who shows the most interest and setting up dates with the others. Social circle game and container events can be an effective way to game because they allow you to consistently line up your week with dates.

Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the mere exposure effect, which suggests that the more time you spend with someone, the more attractive they become. Therefore, hosting weekly container events can help to build familiarity and attraction with potential dating prospects.

This section discusses the importance of group pulls versus isolation. It emphasizes the significance of building trust and comfort with the entire group instead of just isolating the girl. By inviting and pulling the entire group back to your place or an after-party, you can win the peer group over and be the only guy who did not try to rip their friend away from the group. Attractive women will almost always be in groups, and the key is to connect with the peer group and set up the night so that the entire group is excited and willing to go for the pull. The section also discusses the importance of plausible deniability for a successful pull. It is giving her reasons to come back to your place that have nothing to do with sex and providing her with plausible deniability for the escalation. Finally, the section emphasizes the significance of the "3 am rule," which focuses on giving her a reason to come back to your place that has nothing to do with sex, creating a pleasure bubble, and making sure that she is comfortable and has a connection with you.

The story I will share today is a simple but powerful example of the importance of making decisive decisions. Bob and Jim, went out clubbing and ended up at an after party with ten girls. Bob and Jim knew that having a 5:1 girl-to-guy ratio was a good thing, as the guys become the scarce resource and the girls have to compete for their attention.

When it came time to make a move, Bob was indecisive and kept asking his girl if she wanted to go to the jacuzzi. The girl was unsure and said maybe, which only made Bob more wishy-washy. Meanwhile, Jim saw that Bob's lack of decisiveness was causing the other girls to also be unsure and hesitant. So Jim took charge and became the leader of the group. He grabbed his girl's hand and said, "You guys are taking too long. We're going to the jacuzzi now so we'll meet you there."

Because Jim was decisive and took charge, the girl naturally followed him. This is similar to the natural order of things in salsa dancing, where men lead and women follow. The more decisive the man is in leading, the more the woman can trust and follow him. Jim even used plausible deniability when he stopped by his apartment to grab his "bathing suit" before heading to the jacuzzi.

In the end, Bob went home empty-handed while Jim enjoyed a fun night with his girl. The difference between the two students was that one was decisive in his decisions and actions, while the other was not.

When you're at home and trying to pull a girl, focus on the one who shows you the most interest. You can determine this by gaming all the girls and seeing who you have natural chemistry with. Once you've isolated the girl, pre-selection and social proof will make you more attractive to her and her friends. Remember that as a man, you should always lead the interaction forward and have a clear end goal in mind. To set the mood, take four key repeatable steps as soon as you enter your place: take off your shoes, play music, offer shots, and give a tour. However, being discrete is just as important. Don't brag to your friends about hooking up with someone, and keep the girl's privacy in mind. If you want to build pre-selection and status, don't constantly escalate on girls in public. Instead, let them come to you by running container events and pulling the girl who shows the most interest.
