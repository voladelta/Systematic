1) develop a bias for moving fast
2) consistently ask, “What’s the real goal here and is there a better way to accomplish it?”
3) decide how to measure progress
4) measure it regularly

A secret for discovering really great things: look for things that are said to have a "#cult" following. Sometimes this is literally true, but other times it's because the thing is genuinely great, but not everyone knows yet.

Must understand the structure of the thing. The block, the glue, the placement of it. This give us the better sense of meaning. Block patterns or combinations of blocks. 
Time - Space - Energy


Don’t ask people what they want. Watch them and figure out their needs. If you ask, people usually focus on what they have and ask for it to be better: cheaper, faster, smaller. A good observer might discover that the task is unnecessary, that it is possible to restructure things or provide a new technology that eliminates the painstaking parts of their procedures. If you just follow what people ask for, you could end up making their lives even more complicated.

People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.

To my seemingly endless point that logistics is a map of human action. NOTHING IS REAL UNTIL SOMETHING MOVES.

To begin you must study the end. You don’t want to be the first to act, you want to be the last man standing.

If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.
