Space-Time-Bridging

The meditation method Space-Time-Bridging was created by neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman and helps you get present (calm & alert), optimize your focus to get the right things done and access an inspired, hyper-creative state.

Complete each step while connecting it to one breath. Repeat the three steps as long as you want, at least 3 minutes.

1. Sense Your Brain
Breathe in: “Internalize” your attention, gently placing it on a point inside your head, e.g. your third eye or the point between your eyes.

2. Focus
Breathe out: Open your eyes and focus them on a single point closeby, e.g. your hand.

3. Defocus
Breathe in: See the whole picture at once; relax your eyes and take in everything in your field of vision.
