But here’s the thing: he may not need to build the wall to achieve his trade ambitions – he just needs people to believe that he might. Similarly, he doesn’t need to repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement – he just needs to raise it as a possibility.

## The Bad News and the Good News
After landing at Gatwick Airport, the plane taxied for five minutes or so before coming to a halt, the terminal still somewhere in the distance. I heard the engines wind down and a horrible thought occurred to me: we might be about to be loaded onto a bus. I had always felt mildly resentful about being bussed to the terminal, suspecting that it was a tactic used by airlines to save landing fees by parking far away from the terminal building and avoid paying for an airbridge.

Then the pilot made an announcement that was so psychologically astute that I felt like offering him a job at Ogilvy. ‘I’ve got some bad news and some good news,’ he said. ‘The bad news is that another aircraft is blocking our arrival gate, so it’ll have to be a bus; the good news is that the bus will drive you all the way to passport control, so you won’t have far to walk with your bags.’

After decades of flying, I suddenly realised that what he had said was not just true on that occasion – it was always true! The bus drops you off exactly where you need to be, meaning that you don’t have to lug your carry-on bags through miles of corridors before you can get to the exit – this was a revelation. We soon arrived at passport control, and were all rather grateful for the bus. Nothing had changed objectively, but we now saw the bus not as a curse but as a bit of a bonus. The pilot’s alchemical approach had redirected my attention to a different judgement.

## Given Enough Material to Work On, People Often Try to Be Optimistic
One characteristic of humans is that we naturally direct our attention to the upside of any situation if an alternative narrative is available, minimizing the downside. By giving people good news and bad news at the same time, you can make them much happier than they would be if left with only one interpretation: that pilot was perhaps cleverer than he knew.

One of most amusing and telling stories in the recent history of behavioural economics appears in Richard Thaler’s memoir, Misbehaving (2015), when he describes what happened when the University of Chicago Economics Faculty was required to move to a new building. These people are, in theory, the most rational in the world, who should have had at their disposal every possible strategy for collective decision-making in allocating the offices, which varied slightly in size and in status (a corner office being more desirable than an office with one window). Some of them suggested an auction, but this idea was quickly rejected – it was regarded as unacceptable for elderly Nobel Laureates to have smaller offices than their younger colleagues just because the latter had lucrative consulting practices and could afford to pay for the best offices. There was a great deal of feuding and obsessing over tiny differences in size.

I suggested to Professor Thaler that there might have been a simpler way to solve the problem by using a little psychological alchemy: why not rank both the offices and the faculty parking spaces between 1 and 100 in order of desirability before allocating them by lottery, with the people who received the best offices receiving the worst parking spots, and vice versa? Under these conditions, people allocate greater importance to the part of the lottery in which they have come out best, while those in the middle reframe the result as being a happy compromise.

I was familiar with this system because it was how rooms had been allocated at my university college, a practice that I believe has gone on for centuries. In their first year, everyone is allocated a fairly standard room in college – none of the markedly good ones are given to first-year students. In their second year, a ballot is run, with the person at the top receiving the first pick, the second the second, and so on; and in the third year, the positions on the ballot are reversed. I never met anybody who was unhappy with the result.

This seems to offer an extraordinarily valuable psychological insight into the best way to divide unequal resources between a random collection of people – when presented with either good plus bad, bad plus good or average plus average, everybody seems equally content. In fact, we seem well-disposed to explicit trade-offs. A sentence which contains bad and good news, along the lines of, ‘Yes we admit downside x, but also think of upside y,’ seems particularly persuasive. Robert Cialdini has observed that, as you are closing a sale, the admission of a downside oddly adds persuasive power: ‘Yes, it is expensive, but you’ll soon find it’s worth it,’ seems to be a strangely persuasive construction – explicitly mentioning a product’s weakness enables people to downplay its importance and accept the trade-off, rather than endlessly worrying about the potential downside. If you are introducing a new product, it might pay to bear this in mind.

When you think about it, it is rather strange how explicit low-cost airlines are about what their ticket prices don’t include: a pre-allocated seat, a meal, free drinks, free checked luggage – such deficiencies help to explain and destigmatise the low prices. ‘Oh, I see,’ you can say, when you see a flight to Budapest advertised for £37, ‘the reason that low price is possible is because I won’t be paying for a lot of expensive fripperies that I probably don’t want anyway.’ It’s an explicit, well-defined trade-off, and one that we feel happy to accept.

Imagine if cheap airlines instead claimed: ‘We’re just as good as British Airways, but at a third of the price.’ Either nobody would believe them, or else such a claim would raise instant doubts: ‘Maybe the only reason they’re cheaper is because they don’t bother servicing the engines or training the pilots, or because the planes are scarcely airworthy.’

So, marketing can not only justify a high price but it can also detoxify a low one. Make something too cheap without sufficient explanation and it simply might not be believable – after all, things which seem too good to be true usually are.

## Sour Grapes, Sweet Lemons and Minimising Regret
My airport bus transfer experience illustrates a simple truth about human psychology that was spotted over two thousand years ago by a wise storyteller called Aesop. It appears in several of his fables including, most famously, the story of the fox and the grapes. A fox gazes longingly at a beautiful bunch of grapes hanging from the high branch of a tree, his mouth watering. He jumps to reach them, but misses by a long way. He tries again and again, but each time it is in vain. Sitting down, he looks at the grapes in disgust. ‘What a fool I am,’ he says, ‘wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes* that are not worth the effort.’

The moral of the fable is that many pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. This seems fair enough, though it is worth asking how our lives would feel if we did not play this mental trick on ourselves – we might go about in a constant state of resentment because we were not the billionaire recipient of a Nobel Prize.

The opposite phenomenon to sour grapes is often called ‘sweet lemons’, where we ‘decide’ to put a positive spin on a negative experience. Both these mental tricks are types of ‘regret minimisation’ – given the chance, our brain will do its best to lessen any feelings of regret, though it does need a plausible alternative narrative to do this. Thinking back to my experience at the airport, the reason I had previously hated being bussed to the terminal was not because it was intrinsically bad, but because there didn’t seem to be anything that would help me frame it in a more positive light. Once I knew of an upside, I was able to choose to see the bus as a conveyance and not an annoyance. As Shakespeare wrote, ‘there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so’.

A few hours before I sat down to write this chapter, I received a parking ticket. It was only for £25 and I was completely to blame, but it nevertheless annoyed me to an extraordinary degree – and it is still annoying me now. Perhaps a parking ticket is made even more annoying because we can see no way of reframing it in a positive light.

Could the local authority that issued me with the ticket give me a chance to play the same mental trick on myself as the easyJet pilot – a reason, however tenuous, to feel slightly upbeat about the fine? For instance, how different would I feel if I was told that the money from my fine would be invested into improving local roads or donated to a homeless shelter? The fine would have the same deterrent effect, but my level of anger and resentment would be significantly reduced. How would that be a bad thing?

## What Works at a Small Scale Works at a Large Scale
Why don’t we take the insight gained from our experiences of easyJet and parking tickets and apply it to something larger? Public services are sometimes disliked by the people who use them not because they are worse than private sector services, but because the link between what you pay and what you gain is so opaque that it prevents people from creating a positive narrative about the taxes they pay.

I once examined a breakdown of what my local taxes are spent on: it seemed that I paid £25 per year for weekly refuse collection – reframing this as 50p per week, I was struck by what good value it was. For less than the cost of a stamp, someone would come to my house and remove and dispose of several bags of refuse; suddenly the council seemed more impressive than they had before.

One problem with governments is that they generally hate hypothecation, the system whereby taxes are ring-fenced and spent on a pre-defined area of activity. Instead, taxation tends to go into one pot, before being spent wherever it is needed. As a result, we end up resenting taxation more than expenditure that goes towards something we can see, feel or even imagine.

By contrast, consider for a second the success of private organisations in securing philanthropic donations when they can offer the donor something in return – even something as trivial as naming rights to a building. The taxation we give to the government doesn’t provide us with the opportunity to create a narrative that might make us happy about what we pay. Taxes, like parking fines, are seen as wholly bad, but a little alchemy could solve this problem quite easily. In ancient Rome, wealth taxes were levied to fund military campaigns or public works, and since the names of the people who paid them were displayed on a monument, with the money dedicated to a specific end, rich people were happy to pay, with those initially deemed too poor to be liable volunteering themselves, saying ‘Actually I’m much richer than you think.’

People who are happy to spend £300 on a pair of designer sunglasses feel resentful when they are required to pay that amount on funding healthcare, policing, the fire brigade or defence, yet many of us would voluntarily pay more tax if it were possible to specify which service would receive the money.* If you allowed people to tick a box on their income tax form whereby they paid 1 per cent extra to improve healthcare, many people would happily do so. And if you then gave them a car sticker to display the fact that they had paid more, as the Romans effectively did, even more people would join in. How would that be a bad thing? And yet, for some reason, government institutions and businesses seem to shy away from such solutions. Perhaps they think of them as cheating; maybe they are cheating, but the fact remains that, if emotional responses have such an influence on our brain, we have no choice but to at least try to present things in a way that it finds least emotionally painful.

Remember, no one will buy a fish, however tasty, if it’s called the Patagonian toothfish.

And similarly, perhaps no 26-year-old will ever buy a financial product, however advantageous it may be to them, if it is called a pension. At present the UK Government spends over £25 billion each year on tax rebates for pension contributions, a staggeringly generous incentive to save for retirement by any standards, and yet it is staggeringly ineffective. I was recently part of a group that met to discuss what the government could do to make paying into a pension more appealing, particularly to younger people, without requiring such a high level of financial subsidy. We were all impressed by the work that Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi had already performed in this field: together, they conceived a new mechanism for pension-saving that acknowledges one of the central principles of behavioural psychology – loss-aversion, the mental mechanism that causes us to experience more pain from losing £100 than pleasure from winning £100.

A typical pension works like this: if you buy a pension plan for £250 a month, every month thereafter you are £250 poorer, until your retirement, when you can redeem the annual salary which that pension provides. By contrast, Thaler and Benartzi’s ‘Save More Tomorrow’ pension worked differently: you signed up for a pension at a certain rate (let’s say 20 per cent) but instead of starting immediately, your contributions would only represent a proportion of any future wage rises. So if you were given a £500-a-month pay rise, 20 per cent of it (if that is what you had chosen) would go towards your pension. The same would apply to further pay rises: if, in your fifties, you were earning £50,000 more annually than when you took out the pension, you would by then be paying £10,000 each year into a retirement fund. The result was that people taking out a ‘Save More Tomorrow’ pension would never be poorer because of it – they would just be ‘less richer’. To an economist these two states are identical, but to the evolved human brain they are very different.

The idea worked: compared to the control group, twice as many people were willing to participate in the scheme and, of those who did, the average contributions after seven years were roughly double. This can be regarded as alchemy, because it has created a change in behaviour without requiring any material incentive – it simply offers a behaviour that is more congruent with how our brains really work.

No less significant was the success of the UK Government in creating pension-saving by default when they introduced auto-enrolment. As a result, over seven million people now have pensions who did not have them before.

We are a herd species in many ways: we feel comfortable in company and like to buy things in packs. This is not irrational – it is a useful heuristic that helps avoid catastrophe. Antelope might be able to find slightly better grass by escaping their herd and wandering off on their own, but a lone one would need to spend a large proportion of its time looking out for predators rather than grazing; even if the grass is slightly worse with the herd, they are able to safely spend most of their time grazing, because the burden of watching for threats is shared by many pairs of eyes rather than one. Consumers have a similar instinct – we would rather make a suboptimal decision in company than a perfect decision alone. This is also sensible, even if it isn’t conventionally ‘rational’ – a problem is much less worrying when shared.*

One of our ideas for making pensions more appealing was to exploit this herd mentality: if you sold pensions to groups of people who all knew each other – the members of a sports club, for instance – the likely levels of trust would be much higher.

Here are a few of our other suggestions:

1. Tell people how much the state is giving them. A tax rebate is a strange form of incentive, delivered in a way that renders it almost invisible: the increment is not paid to you, but added to your pension contributions, where it soon passes out of sight. What if you received a text every month from the government, saying, ‘We have contributed an extra £400 to your pension this month’?

2. Restrict how much people can save. In the UK, you can pay a ridiculously high amount into a pension and still receive government tax relief. At first glance this seems logical – the more people save, the better – but it doesn’t create a sense that people are missing out if they fail to reach their allowance. It may seem crazy to say that, ‘If you want people to save more, allow them to save less’, but this is the sort of counterintuitive solution that often appears in psychological alchemy.

3. Make pension contributions flexible. In the modern-day gig economy, where wages may not be constant, it would not be difficult for contributors to be sent a text every month asking if they wished to a) maintain their normal payment, b) increase it, or c) take a break from payments.

4. Slightly decrease with age the size of the tax rebate offered, in order to give a clear incentive for people to start saving sooner.

5. Enable people to draw money from their pension before they retire. It is ridiculous to be paying 25 per cent interest on a credit card while you have £100,000 sitting in a pension account. And if people want to take a year off work to travel, why shouldn’t a pension fund this?*

Even if you disagree with some of these suggestions, I think you would probably acknowledge that some combination of them would motivate saving more effectively than the present system does. What is really telling is that, if you assume that economics needs to be objectively ‘true’, none of them* would even be considered.

## Find Different Expressions for the Same Thing
Imagine a set of four cards is placed on a table – each of them has a number on one side and a colour on the other. The visible faces on the cards are 5, 8, blue and green. Which card (or cards) must you turn over in order to test the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is blue?

(Wason Cards – and how context matters. This test baffled most Princeton students.)

A surprising number of bright people get the answer wrong – including, in one test, the majority of Princeton students. Overall, fewer than one in ten people gets this right first time, though no one has any difficulty understanding the problem once the correct answer is explained.

The most common mistake is to assume that you should turn over the blue card; in fact, because the rule says nothing about odd numbers at all, a blue patch accompanied by either an odd or even number would not invalidate the rule – hence there is no need to turn over the blue card. Instead you should turn over the green card, since if this were backed by an even number the rule would be broken.

As evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby observed, if the same problem is framed in the language of social relations rather than in the rarefied language of logic, the success rate is much higher. For instance, imagine instead that the rule is that you must be over 21 to drink alcohol – on one side of the cards is the age of a drinker, and on the other is the drink they have in their hand.

In this presentation of the problem, nearly everybody gets it right: they check the 19-year-old and the age of the person drinking the beer. The can of Coke doesn’t matter, and the person over 21 can drink whatever they like. No one has any problem coping with that logic, even though it’s the same problem as previously, just framed in a different way. (Yet reframe the same problem in a different way, and any child can do it.)

The job of the alchemist is to find out which framing works best. I persuaded my father to pay for TV at the age of 82, simply by reframing the cost. He begrudged paying £17 a month for a satellite television package – it seemed like a waste of money to him. However, when I pointed out that £17 each month worked out to around 50p a day and he already spent £2 each day on newspapers, everything changed. As 50p a day rather than £17 a month, the same cost seemed perfectly reasonable.

## Create Gratuitous Choices
Provided it is mentally painless, we tend to like choice for its own sake. In the early 1990s, I was working with the recently privatised British Telecom (BT), one of the agency’s largest accounts. They had recently modernised the telephone exchanges throughout Britain, and were as a result able to offer customers radical enhancements to their service. For a few pounds a month you could divert calls to another number or subscribe to ‘Call Waiting’, which let you know if someone else was trying to reach you when you were on the line.

To explain the new services, we sent letters to customers and invited them to subscribe. They were able to opt-in in two ways: either by calling a freephone number, or by ticking a box on a pre-personalised form and returning it in a prepaid envelope – so far, so boring. However, BT had an aversion to allowing people to request the products by post: their argument was that because they were a phone company, we should drive people to use their telephone rather than giving money to the Post Office – they wanted to send out the letters and simply list a phone number as the only mode of response.

To test this, we divided customers into three randomised groups. The first group was offered the choice of responding by phone and post, while the second was only allowed to respond by phone and the third was only able to reply by post. We sent 50,000 letters to each group, and when the responses began to come in, it was soon clear that something strange was going on. The people who had only been offered the chance of responding by phone had a response rate of about 2.9 per cent, and those who only had postal coupons had a response rate of about 5 per cent. But the group who had the choice of responding either by coupon or by phone had a response rate of 7.8 per cent – similar to the sum total of the other two. In economic terms, this was bizarre.

> People seem to like choice for its own sake.

This is one reason why public services and monopolies, even when they do a good job objectively, are often under-appreciated – it is harder to like something when you haven’t chosen it.

It completely mystifies me why most online retailers do not offer you a choice of couriers to deliver your goods. People would vastly prefer this and it would have the additional benefit that they would not wholly blame the retailer if the goods were late or failed to arrive.

## Be Unpredictable
> Control Tower: ‘Maybe we ought to turn on the search lights now?’
> Kramer: ‘No . . . that’s just what they’ll be expecting us to do.’

Most of business is run according to conventional logic. Finance, operations and logistics all operate through established best practice – there are rules, and you need to have a good reason to break them. But there are other parts of a business that don’t work this way, and marketing is one of them: in truth, it’s a part of business where there’s never best practice, because if you follow a standard orthodoxy your brand will become more like your competitors’, thus eroding your advantage. The above joke from Airplane! (1980) appears when the air traffic controller is trying to follow protocol, by turning on the lights on the runway for the approaching plane; Kramer, a war veteran, is frightened of being too predictable. It underlines a serious point.

The marketer’s life can be difficult and lonely. Typically, most of a company’s management will have the mentality of the air traffic controller, with a love of the obvious, whereas the marketer needs to be more like Kramer, with a fear of the obvious. The two mindsets don’t always make for easy bedfellows, and departing from accepted logic can be risky – remember that it is easier to get fired for being illogical than for being unimaginative. Though in many social or complex settings being entirely predictable is hopeless, we tend to fetishise logic.

As Bill Bernbach observed, conventional logic is hopeless in marketing – as you end up in the same place as your competitors.

## Dare to Be Trivial
The combination of 28 words and a button in the below picture has been called ‘the $300m button’, and is frequently cited in articles about web design and user experience. It first appeared on an unnamed retail website, which many experts believe to be Best Buy.

( Continue as Guest )
‘The $300m button’. In fact, monumental effects of this kind are surprisingly common in web design. Perhaps one of the first rules of interface design is ‘don‘t try to be logical’.

Jared Spool, the creator of the button, describes the form that customers from the website previously encountered when they came to complete a purchase: 

‘The form was simple. The fields were Email Address and Password. The buttons were Login and Register. The link was ‘Forgot Password’. It was the login form for the site. It’s a standard form users encounter all the time. How could they have problems with it? But we were wrong about the first-time shoppers. They did mind registering. They resented having to register when they encountered the page. As one shopper told us, “I’m not here to enter into a relationship. I just want to buy something.” Some first-time shoppers couldn’t remember if it was their first time, becoming frustrated as each common email and password combination failed. We were surprised how much they resisted registering. Without even knowing what was involved in registration, all the users that clicked on the button did so with a sense of despair. Many vocalised how the retailer only wanted their information to pester them with marketing messages they didn’t want. Some imagined other nefarious purposes of the obvious attempt to invade privacy.’

Acting on Spool’s advice, the site’s designers fixed the problem simply – they replaced the ‘Register’ button with a ‘Continue’ button and a single sentence: ‘You do not need to create an account to make purchases on our site. Simply click Continue to proceed to checkout. To make your future purchases even faster, you can create an account during checkout.’

The number of customers completing purchases increased by 45 per cent almost immediately, which resulted in an extra $15 million in the first month; in the first year, the site saw an additional $300 million attributable simply to this change.

So, people hate registering, and you can increase sales spectacularly by allowing them to bypass registration? Well, it’s not quite that straightforward – there’s a stranger aspect to this story, which is that most of the site’s customers (90 per cent or so) who chose to ‘continue as guest’ were subsequently happy to register as customers once they had made their purchase – the very people who had baulked at registering before completing the purchase were only too happy to leave their details and create an account at the end of the process. This shows that what mattered was not the actions we asked them to perform, but the order in which they were asked to make them.

Typing your address in order to confirm where your new washing machine should be delivered feels like a good use of your time; performing the same task when all you seem to be doing is adding your details to a customer database feels like a waste of your time.

The same thing in a different context can be pleasant or annoying. It’s that airport bus all over again.

## In Defence of Trivia
The great copywriter Drayton Bird was once chastised by a friend, who said, ‘You advertising people, you go very deeply into the surface of things, don’t you?’ However, although it was intended as a criticism, I think it should be taken as a compliment.

As any devotee of Sherlock Holmes will tell you, paying attention to trivial things is not necessarily a waste of time, because the most important clues may often seem irrelevant and a lot of life is best understood by observing trivial details. No one complained that Darwin was being trivial in comparing the beaks of finches from one island to another, because his ultimate inferences were so interesting.

The mentality of the physicist or the economist assumes that large effects are only obtained by large inputs. The mind of the alchemist understands that the smallest change in context or meaning can have immense effects on behaviour.
