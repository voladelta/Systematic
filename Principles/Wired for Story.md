## What's Your Story?
A story is about how the things that happen affect someone in pursuit of a difficult goal, and how that person changes internally as a result.

Now, let’s crack that shell wide open.

*What happens* in the story is the plot, the surface events of the novel. It is not the same thing as what the story is about. Not by a long shot.

The *someone* is the protagonist, and as we’ll see, everything that happens in the plot will get its meaning and emotional weight based on how it affects her—not in general, but in pursuit of a difficult goal.

The *difficult goal* is, at its most basic, what’s known as the story problem. All stories revolve around how someone solves a single, escalating problem they can’t avoid. After all, if it were easy, it wouldn’t be a problem, and there wouldn’t be a story. It’s not merely a surface problem, either, but one that causes the protagonist to struggle with a specific internal conflict at every turn, so that at the end she sees things quite differently than she did at the beginning.

And that *internal change*? That, my friends, is what the story is actually about: how your protagonist’s external dilemma—aka the plot—changes her worldview.

And just to be clear: if you’re writing a thriller or a mystery—whether a cozy, a hard-boiled police procedural, a courtroom drama, or anything in between—you do not get a pass on the inner story layer. After all, the goal isn’t simply to have your investigator find out who did it; it’s to find out how and why. And *why* is always internal. Think: What’s the real reason for the crime, the hard-won answer to “*What was he thinking?*” In fact, mysteries of all genres tend to have a more complex inner layer, because each key character—the perp, the victim, the investigator—is driven by his or her internal agenda, and viewed through his or her subjective lens.

Story is about what happens internally, not externally. Not fully grasping the importance of this is what tanks countless novels. We don’t come to story simply to watch the events unfold; we come to experience them through the protagonist’s eyes, as she struggles with what to do next. That is what mesmerizes us: it’s what we’re curious about, it’s what gives us the inside info we’re hungry for. Yep, the protagonist’s internal struggle is the story’s third rail, the live wire that sparks our interest and drives the story forward.

## We think in story, which allows us to envision the future
From the very first sentence, the reader must want to know what happens next.

**Do we know whose story it is?** There must be someone through whose eyes we are viewing the world we’ve been plunked into—aka the protagonist. Think of your protagonist as the reader’s surrogate in the world that you, the writer, are creating.

**Is something happening, beginning on the first page?** Don’t just set the stage for later conflict. Jump right in with something that will affect the protagonist and so make the reader hungry to find out what the consequence will be. After all, unless something is already happening, how can we want to know what happens next?

**Is there conflict in what’s happening?** Will the conflict have a direct impact on the protagonist’s quest, even though your reader might not yet know what that quest is?

**Is something at stake on the first page?** And, as important, is your reader aware of what it is?

**Is there a sense that “all is not as it seems”?** This is especially important if the protagonist isn’t introduced in the first few pages, in which case it pays to ask: Is there a growing sense of focused foreboding that’ll keep the reader hooked until the protagonist appears in the not-too-distant future?

**Can we glimpse enough of the “big picture” to have that all-important yardstick?** It’s the “big picture” that gives readers perspective and conveys the point of each scene, enabling them to add things up. If we don’t know where the story is going, how can we tell if it’s moving at all?

## When the brain focuses its full attention on something, it filters out all unneccesary information.
To hold the brain's attention, everything in a story must be there on a need-to-know basis.

**Do you know what the point of your story is?** What do you want people to walk away thinking about? How do you want to change how they see the world?

**Do you know what your story says about human nature?** Stories are our way of making sense of the world, so each and every one tells us something about what it means to be human, whether the author does it on purpose or not. What is your story saying?

**Do the protagonist’s inner issue, the theme, and the plot work together to answer the story question?** How can you tell? Ask yourself: Is my theme reflected in the way the world treats my protagonist? Does each plot twist and turn force my protagonist to deal with his inner issue, the thing that’s holding him back?

**Do the plot and theme stick to the story question?** Remember, the story question will always be in the back of your reader’s mind, and it is the responsibility of each theme-laced event to keep it there.

**Can you sum up what your story is about in a short paragraph?** One way to begin is to ask yourself how your theme shapes your plot. Put yourself through the paces just as we did with Gone with the Wind. It may be painful, but it’ll pay off big time in the end.

## Emotion determines the meaning of everything -- if we're not feeling, we're not conscious.
All stories are emotion based -- if we're not feeling, we're not reading.

**Does your protagonist react to everything that happens and in a way that your reader will instantly understand?** Can we see the causal link between what happened and why she reacted the way she did? Are we aware of what her expectations are so we can tell whether or not they’re being met? And, if she isn’t in the scene in question, do we know how what happens will affect her?

**If you’re writing in the first person, is everything filtered through the narrator’s point of view?** Remember, in the first person, the narrator doesn’t mention anything that doesn’t relate to the story and that doesn’t already have his personal spin stamped on it.

**Have you left editorializing to the op-ed department?** The more you have a message you want to convey, the more you have to trust your story to do it. The joy of reading is getting to make up your own mind about what a story’s ultimate message is. The joy of writing is being stealthy enough to stack the deck so your reader will choose yours.

**Do you use body language to tell us things we don’t already know?** Think of body language as a “tell,” something that cues your reader into the fact that all is not as it seems.

## Everything we do is goal directed, and our biggest goal is figuring out everyone else's agenda, to better achieve our own.
A protagonist without a clear goal has nothing to figure out and nowhere to go.

**Do you know what your protagonist wants?** What does she desire most? What is her agenda, her raison d’être?

**Do you know why your protagonist wants what he wants?** What does achieving his goal mean to him, specifically? Do you know why? In short, what’s his motivation?

**Do you know what your protagonist’s external goal is?** What specific goal does his desire catapult him toward? Beware of simply shoving him into a generic “bad situation” just to see what he will do. Remember, achieving his goal must fulfill a longstanding need or desire—and force him to face a deep-seated fear in the process.

**Do you know what your protagonist’s internal goal is?** One way of arriving at this is to ask yourself, What does achieving her external goal mean to her? How does she think it will affect how she sees herself? What does she think it will say about her? Is she right? Or is her internal goal at odds with her external goal?

**Does your protagonist’s goal force her to face a specific longstanding problem or fear?** What secret terror must she face to get there? What deeply held belief will she have to question? What has she spent her whole life avoiding that she now must either look straight in the eye or wave the white flag of defeat?

## We see the world not as it is, but as we believe it to be
You must know precisely when, and why, your protagonist's worldview was knocked out of alignment.

**Do you know why your story begins when it does?** What clock has started ticking? What is forcing your protagonist to take action, whether she wants to or not?

**Have you uncovered the roots of your protagonist’s specific fears and desires?** Do you know what her inner issue is? Can you trace it all back to specific events in her past? Do you know how her inner issue then thwarted her desire right up to the moment the story begins?

**Have you made your characters reveal their deepest, darkest secrets to you?** I don’t want to go all Big Brother on you, but if you let your characters hold back, we’ll know. Trust me.

**When writing character bios, are you being specific enough?** When you close your eyes, can you envision what happens, or is it still conceptual? If you can’t see it, there will be no yardstick to measure your protagonist’s progress. You can’t have an after without a before.

**Do you know where the story is going?** This isn’t to say you need to know how it ends when you write word one (although it’s not a bad idea), but unless you have some clue where it’s headed, how can you be sure you’ve sown the seeds of the future there on page one?

## We don't think in abstract, we think in specific images
Anything conceptual, abstract, or general must be made tangible in the protagonist's specific struggle

**Have you translated every “generic” into a “specific”?** This is another way of saying, “Do your job.” After all, you don’t want your reader filling in the blanks in ways you never intended.

**Have the specifics gone missing in any of the usual places?** Are there places where the reason, rationale, reaction, memories, or possibilities that underlie your protagonist’s actions are invisible to the reader?

**Can your reader see what, specifically, your metaphors correlate to in the “real world,” grasp their meaning, and picture them, when reading at a clip?** The last thing you want is for your reader to have to reread it three or four times—first to be able to picture it and then to figure out what the heck it means.

**Do all the “sensory details”—that is, what something tastes, feels, or looks like—have an actual story reason to be there, beyond “just because”?** You want to be sure each sensory detail is strategically placed to give us insight into your characters, your story, and perhaps even your theme. And remember, scenery without subtext is a travelogue.

## The brain is wired to stubbornly resist change, even good change
Story is about change, which results only from unavoidable conflict.

**Have you made sure that the basis of future conflict is sprouting, beginning on page one?** Can we glimpse avenues that will lead to conflict? Can we anticipate the problems that the protagonist might not yet be aware of?

**Have you established the “versus” so that the reader is aware of the specific rock and hard place the protagonist is wedged between?** Can we anticipate how he will have to change in order to get what he wants?

**Does the conflict force the protagonist to take action, whether it’s to rationalize it away or actually change?** Imagine what you would want to avoid if you were your protagonist—and then make her face it.

**Have you made sure that the story gains something by withholding specific facts for a big reveal later?** Don’t be afraid of giving too much away; you can always pare back later. Showing your hand is often a very good thing indeed.

**Once the reveal is known, will everything that happened up to that point still make sense in light of this new information?** Remember, the story must make complete sense without the reveal, but in light of the reveal, the story must make even more sense.

## From birth, our brain's primary goal is to make causal connections -- if this, then that
A story follows a cause-and-effect trajectory from start to finish.

**Does your story follow a cause-and-effect trajectory beginning on page one, so that each scene is triggered by the one that preceded it?** It’s like setting up a line of dominoes—you tap that first one, and they all fall in perfect order as each scene puts the “decision” made in the prior scene to the test.

**Does everything in your story’s cause-and-effect trajectory revolve around the protagonist’s quest (the story question)?** If it doesn’t, get rid of it. It’s that easy.

**Are your story’s external events (the plot) spurred by the protagonist’s evolving internal cause-and-effect trajectory?** We don’t care about a hurricane, a stock market crash, or aliens taking over planet Earth unless it somehow directly affects your protagonist’s quest.

**When your protagonist makes a decision, is it always clear how she arrived at it, especially when she’s changing her mind about something?** Don’t forget, just because you know what your protagonist is thinking doesn’t mean your readers will.

**Does each scene follow the action, reaction, decision pattern?** It’s like the one, two, three of a waltz. Get that rhythm stuck in your head—action, reaction, decision—and then use it to build momentum.

**Can you answer the “And so?” to everything in the story?** Ask this question relentlessly, like a four-year-old, and the minute you can’t answer, know that you’re likely in the company of a darling, a digression, or something else likely to cause your story to go into free fall.

## The brain uses stories to simulate how we might navigate difficult situation in the future
A story's job is to put protagonist through test that, even in her wildest dream, she doesn't think she can pass.

**Has everything that can go wrong indeed gone wrong?** Don’t be nice, even a little bit. Throw social conventions out the window. Does your plot continually force your protagonist to rise to the occasion?

**Have you exposed your protagonist’s deepest secrets and most guarded flaws?** No matter how embarrassing or painful the revelation, have you forced him to fess up? Have you obliged him to confront his demons? How can he possibly overcome them (or realize that they aren’t so bad after all) unless he’s forced to come to grips with them?

**Does your protagonist earn everything she gets, and pay for everything she loses?** This is another way of saying that there must be a consequence to everything that happens. Ideally, it’s a consequence that forces your protagonist to take an action she’d really rather not.

**Does everything your protagonist does to make the situation better actually make it worse?** Good! The worse things get for your protagonist, the better for your story. By making sure that things go from bad to worse, you will keep your story’s pacing on track as the tension—and the stakes—ratchet ever upward.

**Is the force of opposition personified, present, and active?** It doesn’t always have to be a giant, raging gorilla or a gun-toting psychopath, but readers want someone (or something) to root against. This means that vague threats, generalized “evil,” or unspecified possible disastrous events don’t cut it. The danger needs to be specific—and wired to a rapidly ticking clock.

## Since the brain abhors randomness, it's always converting raw data into meaningful patterns, to better anticipate what might happen next
Readers are always on the lookout for patterns; to your reader, everything is either a setup, a payoff, or a road in between.

**Are there any inadvertent setups lurking in your story?** Are you sure nothing whispers, implies, or suggests “setup” without actually meaning it? Remember: a great tool for ferreting out unintended setups is our old friend, the “And so?” test.

**Is there a clear series of events—a pattern—that begins with the setup and culminates in the payoff?** Are you absolutely sure none of your payoffs is piggybacking onto its setup? Equally important, are you sure there is an actual pattern of “dots” or “tells” leading from each setup to its payoff?

**Do the “dots” build?** If you connect the dots between the setup and the payoff, do they add up? Does a pattern emerge? Will your reader see the escalating progression and be able to draw conclusions from it and so, anticipate what might happen next?

**Is the payoff of each of your setups logistically possible?** Be sure to think each setup all the way through to its logical conclusion, even those (especially those) you know your protagonist won’t take more than a step or two toward before circumstances (courtesy of you) force him to abandon it.

## The brain summons past memories to evaluate what's happening in the moment in order to make sense of it
Foreshadowing, flashbacks, and subplots must instantly give readers insight into what's happening in the main storyline, even if the meaning shifts as the story unfolds.

**Do all your subplots affect the protagonist, either externally or internally, as he struggles with the story question**? Readers don’t want subplots just because they’re interesting or lyrical or provide a nice break from the intensity of the main action. Although they may be all these things, first and foremost, the reader expects they’ll be there for a story reason. So ask yourself: Even if it’s tangential, how does this subplot affect the protagonist’s pursuit of his goal? What specific information does it give your reader that she needs to know in order to really grasp what’s happening to the protagonist?

**When you leap into a subplot or flashback, can the reader sense why it was necessary at that very moment?** Make sure the logic is on the page, not just in your head. When you leave the main storyline, you want the reader to follow you willingly, not kicking and screaming.

**When returning to the main storyline, will your reader see things with new eyes from that moment on?** You want her to come back to the main storyline feeling as though she has new insight that gives her the inside track on what’s going on.

**When the protagonist does something out of character, has it been foreshadowed?** Make sure you’ve given the reader solid tells along the way, so her reaction will be “Aha!” rather than “Give me a break!”

**Have you given your reader enough information to understand what’s happening, so that nothing a character does or says leaves her wondering whether she missed something?** You never want your reader to have to pause, trying to figure out what she’s missed, and then—god forbid—leaf back through the book to try to figure it out.
