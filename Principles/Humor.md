## Humor Code
So Pete and Caleb set upon improving Veatch’s work and ended up with a new comedic axiom: the benign violation theory. 

According to this amended theory, humor only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling or threatening (i.e., a violation), but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable, or safe (i.e., benign). 

When something is just a violation, such as somebody falling down the stairs, people feel bad about it. But according to Pete and Caleb, when the violation turns out to be benign, such as someone falling down the stairs and ending up unhurt, people often do an about-face and react in at least one of three ways: they feel amused, they laugh, or they make a judgment—“That was funny.”

(Benign (Benign & Violation) Violation)

the term “benign,” rather than “normal,” better encapsulated the many ways a violation could be okay, acceptable, or safe—and gave them a clear-cut tool to determine when and why a violation such as the feline-turned-sex-toy story can be funny.

## THREES
The THREES formula focuses on the what and why of humor. The what is the target, and the why is the hostility, realism, exaggeration, emotion, and surprise contained in the humor.

### Target: Aiming Your Humor
A humor target can be almost anything or anybody, but you need to be sure you’ve focused on the right target for your particular audience.
- Self: Pick on Somebody Your Own Size
- Sex: Talk Dirty to Me
- Celebrities and Politicians: Humor Fodder and Mudder
- Places: Living in a Crass House
- Products: Malice in Wonderland
- Ideas: Fools of the Game
- Addictions: Just One More

### Hostility: Ridicruel
Humor is a powerful antidote to many of the hostile feelings in our daily lives. All of us have hostility toward some target.

> Comedy comes from conflict, from hatred. — Warren Mitchell

- Authority: Sock It to Me
- Money and Business: The Loot of All Evil
- Family Affairs: Coming Home Soon
- Angst: The Ecstasy and the Agony
- Technology: Now Fear This
- Group Differences: Us vs. Them

### Realism: Raise Your Sites
> “Most good jokes state a bitter truth,” said scriptwriter Larry Gelbart. 

Without some fundamental basis of truth, there’s little with which the audience can associate. But jokes also bend the truth, and the challenge is to learn how to tell the truth (be realistic) while lying (exaggerating).

### Exaggeration: Talking Up a Storm

### Emotion: Burst the Bubble
Hostility, over- or understated, is not enough. There must be a buildup of anticipation in the reader or audience. This is really nothing more than the writer’s skill in using emotion to produce tension and anxiety. It’s a trick. Think of hostility as an inflated balloon. When you create tension in your audience, you are effectively adding more and more air to that balloon, building the audience’s anticipation over when the balloon will burst. They can hardly keep their eyes off the stunt. The writer’s goal is to see that the balloon bursts with laughter, not hot air.

### Surprise: Nobody Knows the Stumbles I’ve Seen
> To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it! — Charlie Chaplin

“Comedy is mentally pulling the rug out from under each person in your audience,” wrote Gene Perret. “But first, you have to get them to stand on it. You have to fool them, because if they see you preparing to tug on the rug, they’ll move.”
