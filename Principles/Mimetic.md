~All non instinctual desire is mimetic

We want things not because they are inherently desirable, but because someone else's desire for them has made them attractive to us.

> Think of two kids and two identical dolls.  One child picks up one doll, and immediately the other child has the insatiable desire to take way that doll, ignoring the identical one right next to it. That’s mimetic desire.

We desire not so much someone's car or house as much as the quality of being that seems to belong to the people who have those possessions. Desire is never just a straight line between a subject and an object, but always has some other as its model. Desire is shaped by imitation.

Other animals imitate, but they don't imitate to the degree we do. We don't just imitate on a monkey see/do level. We imitate on a perception level. We imitate what we perceive our neighbor's desires to be. We don't first think & then desire—the opposite.

Our understanding of the mind still assumes that people have "ideas" in their head and that "reason" determines how they behave. Doesn't take status into account.

It's like the Christian emphasis on “faith”, i.e that some people have “faith”, which makes them more noble people.

The more similar we are, the more we'll want the same things. And the more we want the same things, the more we'll tend to fight over the scarce good (or status). And so we face a permanent threat of runaway violence. Conflict brings convergence, which then brings more conflict.

We want others to love what we love, admire what we admire, but when they do, we suddenly find that they have become competitors, leading to conflict.

Mentor/mentee dynamic is a perfect example. Master wants pupil to imitate the master up until the pupil becomes the master.

The first cultures dealt with threat of runaway violence  by transferring their violence to a surrogate victim, a scapegoat whose death/expulsion unites and ends violence

The antidote to chaos is the ritual scapegoating of a common enemy: "the foundational murder" / "noble lie"

And because the community owes its entire order to its victim, the victim is worshipped as scared. But at the same time, the victim is also believed to be  guilty, and therefore deserving of the collective violence. Scapegoating worked in restoring order, so people kept doing it.

People need something to blame to hide from the fact that they are angry out of endlessly imitating each other. Need a safe space to place all their violence.

Scapegoating is the protection of the community against violence that it could not otherwise control. The scapegoat ritual addresses the threat of uncontrolled violence, which is endemic to human society b/c of runaway mimetic desire leading to conflict.  Rituals of sacrifice averted this crisis by reconciling everyone around a sacrificial victim. It's a collective release.

However, scapegoating preserves social peace only so long as the scapegoaters think it's justified. That, after all, was the definition of scapegoating: persecution of an innocent victim believed to be guilty. Christianity, of course, inverts this myth. Now the victim's innocent. 

If you see the truth of that violence, suddenly that violence repels you. Jesus's cross instead of ratifying his guilt, proclaims his innocence. Before the cross, every violence is portrayed as heroic in literature. Now, not anymore. Scapegoating's no longer sacred. Left a vacuum. 

Jesus says, If you have to imitate someone, imitate me, because I won't imitate others and I won't become your rival. And imitate others who imitate me too. Instead of eye for an eye, turn the other cheek. Instead of sanctifying sacrificial violence, sanctify love and mercy.

Jesus introduced a new spirit of self-awareness & self-criticism. More so than anytime in history, we're aware of our faults. The west is the only place where we self-flagellate our own culture to gain status. Ironically, this is Christianity w/o Christ.

Today, we see the violence of Christianity, we don't see the violence, Christianity has prevented all through history. Christianity didn't invent violence, but it did contribute to curbing it. Where did we get your sensitivity to violence, after all? Certainly wasn't Oedipus Rex.

Eye for an eye today seems primitive, but at the time it was revolutionary. It advocated for reciprocal violence instead of escalation, which used to be the norm. B/c we don’t want to renounce scapegoating, we keep attempting sacrificial violence, but it doesn’t bind us anymore.

Remember, the importance of sacred sacrificial violence in the primordial past was that it bound us together. It prevented us from contagiously envying one another to the point where we’re obsessed with destroying each other rather than just getting on with life.

Ironically, as society became both more egalitarian and meritocratic, and hierarchies were less rigid, mimetic competition skyrocketed. Where previously people were only competing with their own caste, now they were competing with everyone in the world, & expected to win. Chaos.

Nietzsche knew that Christianity was the reason why that resentment was building to such a deep level that once we killed the idea of a God that kept hierarchies stable, mimetic mayhem would ensue.

Resentiment is a begrudging those who you perceive to have things that you desire.

We didn't stop burning witches bc of the scientific method, we got the scientific method bc we stopped burning witches. If, say, ppl's crops were dying, & they burned a "witch", & then crops grew, they kept doing it.

When they stopped, they could evaluate other reasons (science!).

People will always find scapegoats.

"Experience suggests that if men cannot struggle on behalf of a just cause b/c that just cause was victorious in an earlier generation....They will struggle, out of a certain boredom: for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle".

Today it's this game of guilt, hot potato, where we're becoming more increasingly haunted by our guilt in collective violence. And we're trying to throw that hot potato onto somebody else.

Scapegoating used to literally mean the transferring of sins to the goats. Now we do people.

We’re half Christian. We’re thoroughly within the fishbowl of Christianity, but we’re, only half Christian in the sense that we’re aware of victimization, but we don’t want to fully recognize how it affects what we do today, and so we justify violence in victimization's name.

Today, we have new problems. 

Jesus popped the scape goat bubble told us to imitate him, but we don't want to anymore. 

Mob frenzies and scapegoating are society trying to purge itself of its own demons.

Secular Christianity imports from real Christianity what Nietzsche called “slave mentality”, the glorification of the victim. “The first shall be last and the last shall be first.”

And so if your sense of self identity and morality is all wrapped up in that, then any differential success you or other people may achieve is evidence of evil. And so the source of that evil must be identified and eliminated.

The cycle will repeat until either every possible scapegoat is dead or the movement burns itself out.

We all have the motivation to purge our sense of collective sin, independent of the guilt or innocence of the subject.

And the overpowering need to participate.

We live in a MIMETIC SOCIETY, in which right and wrong are largely determined by what others do, can do, and are expected to do. Imitation is the norm.

It seems irrational, but it increases survival, *under the right conditions*.

Using popularity as a proxy for right or wrong is often a good risk management strategy.
Not only to manage social risk (eg, losing friends due to an unpopular action) but also to manage other kind of risks (eg, visiting McDonald's when in a foreign city to avoid stomachache).

Imitation is not as naive a strategy as it looks like. In a world where people are subject to natural selection, on average, imitation necessarily means imitation of those who survived. Hopefully, implying that we imitate behaviors that promote survival.

In the modern world, in which natural selection is much weaker (at least natural selection from the environment), instead, we might end up imitating the unfit.

Moreover, people are differently subject to mimetic forces. 

A small portion of the population is made of "independent thinkers". 
(It would be the "innovators" from The Adoption Curve)

I wouldn't be surprised if the optimal survival strategy at the species level were "most, mimetic; few, independent".

The independent thinkers take risks. If and only if they are successful, the larger population follows them.

 (Side note: this thread pains me, as intellectual independence is a value I cherish much; however, I try to be objective in my observations of nature.)
 
 I always wondered whether gullibility is a naturally-selected trait, for it leads to survival, in a measure. I wonder if we not only evolved intelligence, but also variance on intelligence.

As an example, basketball player James Harden was the 2018 Most Valuable Player. Would a team of 5 James Hardens beat a balanced team of 5 all-stars? Probably not.

Nature loves variance, for it is required for specialization and for adaptation – both which increase fitness.

Back to imitation. When making a choice, once must weight his own knowledge versus the knowledge of others (that would produce imitation). The weight is the probability that one is right and the others wrong. Under natural selection, the weight is very low.

Imitation without fundamental know-how is much of what I stand against. And yet, the right question to ask is, does it help survival?

The answer probably comes from [[Skin in the game]].

A filtering system that ensure that only those who have behaviors which promote survival survive, so that only pro-survival behaviors are copied, for the most part.

Mimetic societies, instead, whereas based on a rational behavior (imitation), they degenerate when they remove skin in the game. See points #2, #11, #16 from Mimetic Societies.

I would therefore conclude: 

- in general, imitation is good*; 
- imitation in a society without skin in the game is a dangerous condition.

(*): provided a small percentage of the population is an independent thinker.

## Triangular Desire: We don’t want things; we want to be things
Human beings are creatures of mimicry. We are evolutionarily supercharged to do one thing better than anyone else: learn by watching and copying others. And the most important thing we learn is how to want. 

As we grow up and live our lives, we watch others and learn what it is we ought to want. Aside from the basics, like food, water, shelter and sex, our desire for any particular object or experience is not hard-coded into our DNA; we’ve learned to want it by watching other people. But what is hard-coded into our DNA and hard-wired into our brains is ==the desire to be; and to belong==. The true root of all desire, Girard and others argue, is never in the objects or the experience we pursue; it’s really about the other person from whom we’ve learned to want these things. 

Girard calls these people the “mediators” or the “models” for our desire: at a deep neurological level, when we watch other people and pattern our desires off theirs, we are not so much acquiring a desire for that object so much as learning to mimic somebody, and striving to become them or become like them. Girard calls this phenomenon *mimetic desire*. ==We don’t want; we want to be.== 

## Two-dimensional versus three-dimensional conflict
The next important piece of the Girardian worldview concerns the nature of human conflict. In children’s stories and other simplistic storylines, we frequently see a kind of Hero’s Journey narrative manifest itself as a sort of ’two-dimensional’ plot: the Hero (good!) wants the Goal (object), and there’s an Obstacle (bad!). In order to succeed, the Hero must overcome the Obstacle in order to reach their Goal. The central relationship in this story is between the Hero and the Object; she will fight through any kind of Obstacle in between. These storylines can be entertaining, but they’re not how human conflict usually presents itself in the world.

In more realistic “three-dimensional” or human conflict, the central relationship that matters isn’t between a Hero and an Object. It’s been the Hero and their ideal, the Model. The Hero wants to become the ideal, and the way that he expresses this desire is by mimicking the model: wanting what the model wants and has. Sometimes this can be a literal object, sometimes it’s a love interest, but usually what the Hero wants is something more ephemeral: status, significance, respect; to be seen as a particular kind of person, and to feel like that person. 

Out in the world, this kind of conflict often manifests itself as the pursuit of status. Status, in mimetic terms, just means being; pure and simple. It can sometimes mean equivalency and inclusion (for someone who’s on the outside trying to get in), or it could mean non-equivalency and exclusion (for someone who’s on the inside and trying to level up to a higher social group and leave behind the rest.) Anyone who’s been a part of a “scene” of some sort will recognize these dynamics really well: a local music scene, where bands are all hanging out with one another and jockeying to hang out with the cooler, bigger band and the gatekeeper record label, is pretty indistinguishable from a local startup scene, where prospective entrepreneurs all jockey to hang out with the successful founders and the gatekeeper VCs. Every scene ultimately comes to resemble the fashion industry: it’s a ritualized, interactive structure for creating and navigating status difference. 

Status, like with many things, is ultimately zero-sum in nature. Models and their admirers eventually and inevitably become rivals. Mutual desire will inevitably turn them into competitors, and the intensity of competition has little to do with the value of the object itself. What matters, again, is the interpersonal relationship. We admire our models for being our inspiration, and we simultaneously come to resent them and hate them for being our obstacle and rival. 

There are two ways that a person might handle this conflict. The first way is to direct the conflict outward: to actively go pursue those objects or experiences that will turn you into the kind of person you want to be; your frustration will be directed towards your mediator and rival, and they will become your enemy. You’ll be motivated by a feeling along the lines of “the reason why I’m not X person or have X is their fault.” The second and more narcissistic way is to direct the conflict inward, and blame yourself for not being the kind of person you aspire to be. “The reason why I’m not X person or have X is my fault.” 

## We do not fight because we’re different; we fight because we are the same
Now, here’s the next key thing to understand, and this is really the anchor for the entire Girardian worldview: ==The amount of distance between the subject and the model matters a great deal. ==

Girard outlines a spectrum between two kinds of models: models who are far from you, and models who are close to you. Models who are far from you, which Girard calls “external mediators”, are like God, heroic figures in culture or history like Raskolnikov’s desire to be seen as an important figure like Napoleon in Crime and Punishment, Don Quixote’s desire to become an “ideally chivalrous” model knight, or a commanding hierarchical figure like a general leading an army: they are not the subject’s peer in any way whatsoever. This distance is important: the subject can strive as much as she likes to become like the model, yet the relationship between the two of them is unlikely to change. The model will never become an obstacle to the hero, because the model is simply too far away; they may not even be a real person. In Girard’s view, these tend to be the good kind of role models.

Models who are close to the subject, which Girard calls “internal mediators”, are a different story. The subject’s efforts to become more like the role model transforms the relationship between the two of them. If someone close to you like your smart coworker, your successful neighbour, or some other kind of peer becomes a model for you, then it will have a powerful effect on a) what you subsequently desire, in your effort to become more like them, and b) your relationship with that person as they progressively become your competitor, obstacle and rival. Your role model torments you, pulling you in two directions simultaneously: “Be like me, because that is what you desire; but also don’t be like me, because to try would expose you as an imitator and embarrass you in front of everybody.” Narcissists, whose role model is themselves, feel a cruel twist: “the harder you try, the more you’re embarrassing to yourself.”

One particularly human feeling along these lines is a certain kind of anxiety: the need to make sure your peers recognize that you have obtained something, or have accomplished something, or in some other way have become a particular type of person; while simultaneously needing to make sure they don’t catch you trying to make sure they see it. To get exposed as a striver is the worst thing that can happen to you, because it basically confirms to everyone else that you’re not that particular person you’re trying to project; we can’t both be X and also be actively striving to become X. (Once again, narcissists experience this in a particularly tormenting way, because the person they’re lying to and are ashamed in front of is themselves.) The closer the role model is to us, the more shame we feel as we flip back and forth between adoringly imitating them and performatively distancing ourselves from them.

## The fight was so fierce because the stakes were so small
There are definitely people out there who intuitively get the idea that “we don’t fight because we’re different; we fight because we are the same”. But they make a key error in understanding why that is the case: they’re stuck thinking in terms of the object being fought over, rather than the relationship between the rivals. They’re still thinking of similarity as “We’re the same because we both want X.” If the conflict was genuinely over an object, we’d expect that the more valuable or precious the object, the more intense the fighting should be. But instead, the opposite is usually more true: the smaller the stakes, the more intense and the more personally ugly the fight. 

Now why is this? There are two reasons; one categorical, the other causative. First, small stakes imply similar participants. It’s hard to imagine a situation where two people very far apart from one another might come into conflict over an inconsequential object. So the smaller the stakes, the closer the participants are likely to be to one another off the bat. Second: the smaller the stakes involved, the more urgently you will be compelled to hide the fact that the root of the fighting is your admiration and jealousy of your peer. If you’re fighting over something big, then your fight is plenty justified in the eyes of others. But the smaller the stakes, the harder you are going to have to work in order to justify your conflict. The way you’re going to do that, in all likelihood, is by fighting dirty: smearing your opponent’s reputation, and waging a campaign to delegitimize him in an effort to draw eyes away from your secret admiration and jealousy. 

Ultimately, these kinds of conflicts threaten to spiral out of control because they’re not over anything; so there’s no possible resolution or compromise that can be made; at least, not concerning the object being allegedly fought over. These fights are strictly symmetric in character; Girard calls them mimetic violence. Historically, mimetic violence between two individuals would often boil over and conclude the only way possible: in a duel to the death. Duels are the inevitable conclusion when neither party will back down, and no compromise is possible because there is no object being fought over that could legitimately coax either party into a truce. More dangerous still, if we keep going back in history, are blood feuds: “You killed someone in my family? I’ll kill someone in your family” becomes such a catastrophically dangerous form of tit for tat violence that it could mortally threaten the survival of entire communities. Without safeguard systems in place, like a formal justice system, runaway mimetic violence is a terrifying prospect. 

Girard’s answer is, essentially, distance and differentiation. A relationship between subject and model that is differentiated, in terms of rank or distance or some other real factor, will be safe; whereas a relationship that is undifferentiated, because the subject and the model are peers, is dangerous. The Girardian mindset basically says, “Lasting peace and harmony inherently requires differentiation. A stable society is a differentiated one.” (If you just had alarm bells go off at that sentence, which you should have, hold on; we’ll get there.)
