## 4 problems that biases help us address
Information overload, lack of meaning, the need to act fast, and how to know what needs to be remembered for later.

### Problem 1: Too much information
There is just too much information in the world, we have no choice but to filter almost all of it out. Our brain uses a few simple tricks to pick out the bits of information that are most likely going to be useful in some way.

- **We notice things that are already primed in memory or repeated often**. This is the simple rule that our brains are more likely to notice things that are related to stuff that’s recently been loaded in memory.
	- See: Availability heuristic, Attentional bias, Illusory truth effect, Mere exposure effect, Context effect, Cue-dependent forgetting, Mood-congruent memory bias, Frequency illusion, Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, Empathy gap

- **Bizarre/funny/visually-striking/anthropomorphic things stick out** more than non-bizarre/unfunny things. Our brains tend to boost the importance of things that are unusual or surprising. Alternatively, we tend to skip over information that we think is ordinary or expected.
	- See: Bizarreness effect, Humor effect, Von Restorff effect, Negativity bias, Publication bias, Omission bias

- **We notice when something has changed**. And we’ll generally tend to weigh the significance of the new value by the direction the change happened (positive or negative) more than re-evaluating the new value as if it had been presented alone. Also applies to when we compare two similar things.
	- See: Anchoring, Contrast effect, Focusing effect, Framing effect, Weber–Fechner law, Distinction bias

- **We are drawn to details that confirm our own existing beliefs**. This is a big one. As is the corollary: we tend to ignore details that contradicts our own beliefs.
	- See: Confirmation bias, Congruence bias, Post-purchase rationalization, Choice-supportive bias, Selective perception, Observer-expectancy effect, Experimenter’s bias, Observer effect, Expectation bias, Ostrich effect, Subjective validation, Continued influence effect, Semmelweis reflex, Bucket error, Law of narrative gravity

- **We notice flaws in others more easily** than flaws in ourselves. Yes, before you see this entire article as a list of quirks that compromise how other people think, realize that you are also subject to these biases.
	- See: Bias blind spot, Naïve cynicism, Naïve realism

### Problem 2: Not enough meaning
The world is very confusing, and we end up only seeing a tiny sliver of it, but we need to make some sense of it in order to survive. Once the reduced stream of information comes in, we connect the dots, fill in the gaps with stuff we already think we know, and update our mental models of the world.

- **We find stories and patterns** even in sparse data. Since we only get a tiny sliver of the world’s information, and also filter out almost everything else, we never have the luxury of having the full story. This is how our brain reconstructs the world to feel complete inside our heads.
	- See: Confabulation, Clustering illusion, Insensitivity to sample size, Neglect of probability, Anecdotal fallacy, Illusion of validity, Masked man fallacy, Recency illusion, Gambler’s fallacy, Hot-hand fallacy, Illusory correlation, Pareidolia, Anthropomorphism

- **We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities, and prior histories** whenever there are new specific instances or gaps in information. When we have partial information about a specific thing that belongs to a group of things we are pretty familiar with, our brain has no problem filling in the gaps with best guesses or what other trusted sources provide. Conveniently, we then forget which parts were real and which were filled in.
	- See: Group attribution error, Ultimate attribution error, Stereotyping, Essentialism, Functional fixedness, Moral credential effect, Just-world hypothesis, Argument from fallacy, Authority bias, Automation bias, Bandwagon effect, Placebo effect

- **We imagine things and people we’re familiar with or fond of as better** than things and people we aren’t familiar with or fond of. Similar to the above but the filled-in bits generally also include built in assumptions about the quality and value of the thing we’re looking at.
	- See: Halo effect, In-group bias, Out-group homogeneity bias, Cross-race effect, Cheerleader effect, Well-traveled road effect, Not invented here, Reactive devaluation, Positivity effect

- **We simplify probabilities and numbers** to make them easier to think about. Our subconscious mind is terrible at math and generally gets all kinds of things wrong about the likelihood of something happening if any data is missing.
	- See: Mental accounting, Normalcy bias, Appeal to probability fallacy, , Base rate fallacy, Murphy’s law, Hofstadter’s law, Subadditivity effect, Survivorship bias, Zero sum bias, Denomination effect, Magic number 7+-2, Swimmer’s body illusion, Money illusion, Conservatism

- **We think we know what others are thinking**. In some cases this means that we assume that they know what we know, in other cases we assume they’re thinking about us as much as we are thinking about ourselves. It’s basically just a case of us modeling their own mind after our own (or in some cases after a much less complicated mind than our own).
	- See: Curse of knowledge, Illusion of transparency, Spotlight effect, Streetlight effect, Illusion of external agency, Illusion of asymmetric insight, Extrinsic incentive error

- **We project our current mindset and assumptions onto the past and future**. Magnified also by the fact that we’re not very good at imagining how quickly or slowly things will happen or change over time.
	- See: Hindsight bias, Outcome bias, Moral luck, Declinism, Telescoping effect, Rosy retrospection, Impact bias, Pessimism bias, Planning fallacy, Time-saving bias, Pro-innovation bias, Projection bias, Restraint bias, Self-consistency bias

### Problem 3: Need to act fast
We’re constrained by time and information, and yet we can’t let that paralyze us. Without the ability to act fast in the face of uncertainty, we surely would have perished as a species long ago. With every piece of new information, we need to do our best to assess our ability to affect the situation, apply it to decisions, simulate the future to predict what might happen next, and otherwise act on our new insight.

- **In order to act, we need to be confident in our ability to make an impact and to feel like what we do is important**. In reality, most of this confidence can be classified as overconfidence, but without it we might not act at all.
	- See: Overconfidence effect, Egocentric bias, Optimism bias, Social desirability bias, Third-person effect, Forer effect, Barnum effect, Illusion of control, False consensus effect, Dunning-Kruger effect, Hard-easy effect, Illusory superiority, Lake Wobegone effect, Self-serving bias, Actor-observer bias, Fundamental attribution error, Defensive attribution hypothesis, Trait ascription bias, Effort justification, Risk compensation, Peltzman effect, Armchair fallacy

- **In order to stay focused, we favor the immediate, relatable thing in front of us over the delayed and distant**. We value stuff more in the present than in the future, and relate more to stories of specific individuals than anonymous individuals or groups. I’m surprised there aren’t more biases found under this one, considering how much it impacts how we think about the world.
	- See: Hyperbolic discounting, Appeal to novelty, Identifiable victim effect

- **In order to get anything done, we’re motivated to complete things that we’ve already invested time and energy in**. The behavioral economist’s version of Newton’s first law of motion: an object in motion stays in motion. This helps us finish things, even if we come across more and more reasons to give up.
	- See: Sunk cost fallacy, Irrational escalation, Escalation of commitment, Loss aversion, IKEA effect, Processing difficulty effect, Generation effect, Zero-risk bias, Disposition effect, Unit bias, Pseudocertainty effect, Endowment effect, Backfire effect

- **In order to avoid mistakes, we’re motivated to preserve our autonomy and status in a group, and to avoid irreversible decisions**. If we must choose, we tend to choose the option that is perceived as the least risky or that preserves the status quo. Better the devil you know than the devil you do not.
	- See: System justification, Reactance, Reverse psychology, Decoy effect, Social comparison bias, Status quo bias, Abilene paradox, Law of the instrument, Law of the hammer, Maslow’s hammer, Golden hammer, Chesterton’s fence, Hippo problem

- **We favor options that appear simple or that have more complete information over more complex, ambiguous options**. We’d rather do the quick, simple thing than the important complicated thing, even if the important complicated thing is ultimately a better use of time and energy.
	- See: Ambiguity bias, Information bias, Belief bias, Rhyme as reason effect, Bike-shedding effect, Law of Triviality, Delmore effect, Conjunction fallacy, Occam’s razor, Less-is-better effect, Sapir-Whorf-Korzybski hypothesis

### Problem 4: What should we remember?
There’s too much information in the universe. We can only afford to keep around the bits that are most likely to prove useful in the future. We need to make constant bets and trade-offs around what we try to remember and what we forget. For example, we prefer generalizations over specifics because they take up less space. When there are lots of irreducible details, we pick out a few standout items to save and discard the rest. What we save here is what is most likely to inform our filters related to problem 1’s information overload, as well as inform what comes to mind during the processes mentioned in problem 2 around filling in incomplete information. It’s all self-reinforcing.

- **We edit and reinforce some memories** after the fact. During that process, memories can become stronger, however various details can also get accidentally swapped. We sometimes accidentally inject a detail into the memory that wasn’t there before.
	- See: Misattribution of memory, Source confusion, Cryptomnesia, False memory, Suggestibility, Spacing effect

- **We discard specifics to form generalities**. We do this out of necessity, but the impact of implicit associations, stereotypes, and prejudice results in some of the most glaringly bad consequences from our full set of cognitive biases.
	- See: Implicit associations, Implicit stereotypes, Stereotypical bias, Prejudice, Fading affect bias

- **We reduce events and lists to their key elements**. It’s difficult to reduce events and lists to generalities, so instead we pick out a few items to represent the whole.
	- See: Peak–end rule, Leveling and sharpening, Misinformation effect, Duration neglect, Serial recall effect, List-length effect, Modality effect, Memory inhibition, Part-list cueing effect, Primacy effect, Recency effect, Serial position effect, Suffix effect

- **We store memories differently based on how they were experienced**. Our brains will only encode information that it deems important at the time, but this decision can be affected by other circumstances (what else is happening, how is the information presenting itself, can we easily find the information again if we need to, etc) that have little to do with the information’s value.
	- See: Picture superiority effect, Levels of processing effect, Testing effect, Absent-mindedness, Next-in-line effect, Tip of the tongue phenomenon, Google effect, Self-relevance effect

## 5 families of biases
### Pattern recognition
Pattern recognition influences our initial hypotheses
- Confirmation, storytelling
	- We pay more attention to facts that support our hypotheses and neglect those that would disconfirm them, particularly when our hypotheses are organized in a coherent narrative
- Champion
	- We give too much weight to the reputation of the messenger vs. the value of the information he bears
- Experience
	- We reason by analogy with situations from our own experience that easily come to mind
- Attribution error
	- We attribute success or failure to the role of individuals and underestimate the role of circumstances and chance
- Hindsight
	- We judge past decisions based on information that was not available at the time they were made, especially about their outcomes
- Halo
	- We form a general impression (of a person, company, etc.) based on a few salient features and let that impression (halo) influence our assessment of unrelated features
- Survivorship
	- We draw conclusions from samples that include successes but exclude failures

### Action-oriented
Action-oriented makes us do things we shouldn’t
- Overplacement
	- We overestimate our relative abilities, i.e., how much better than others we are
- Planning fallacy; unrealistic optimism
	- We do not sufficiently consider things (and combinations of things) that could derail our plans, resulting in an optimistic bias in estimates of time and cost to completion
- Overprecision 
	- We overestimate the degree of confidence we can have in our estimates and forecasts
- Competitor neglect
	- We develop plans that overlook competitors’ likely response to our actions

### Inertia
Inertia makes us fail by inaction
- Anchoring
	- When making estimates, we are influenced by available numbers, even if they are irrelevant
- Resource inertia
	- We are timid in reallocating resources to reflect our stated priorities, especially when these priorities change suddenly
- Status quo
	- We tend to avoid making a decision and to maintain the status quo by default
- Escalation of commitment, sunk-cost fallacy
	- We double down on a failing course of action, notably because we do not treat the resources previously invested as sunk costs
- Loss aversion
	- We feel a loss more keenly than a gain of the same amount
- Irrational risk aversion
	- We refuse to take reasonable risks, fearing that, in case of failure, our choices will seem foolish in hindsight and we will be unjustly blamed
- Uncertainty aversion
	- We prefer a quantified risk, even if it’s high, over an unknown risk (“uncertainty” or “ambiguity”)

### Social
Social allows organizations to let mistakes happen
- Groupthink
	- In a group, we silence our doubts and side with the prevailing opinion instead of dissenting
- Polarization
	- Groups tend to reach a conclusion that is more extreme than the average viewpoint of their members—and to be more confident in it
- Information cascades
	- In a group, the sequence of speakers affects the outcome of the discussion, as private information is withheld and shared information emphasized

### Interest
Interest further colors the judgments of individual decision makers
- Self-serving
	- We genuinely believe in viewpoints that happen to coincide with our interests, financial or otherwise (including emotional attachments)
- Present
	- We use inconsistent discount rates when making present-future trade-offs, leading us to overweight the present (managerial myopia)
- Omission 
	- We are more indulgent with errors of omission than errors of commission, and find it morally acceptable to benefit from them

## List of biases
### Reward & Punishment Superresponse
In Munger’s experience, people tend to be most motivated by incentives; especially by the
right rewards. By understanding incentives, you can more effectively:
- Influence Others. Want to get an individual or a team to do something? Munger says you need to answer this question correctly: “What’s in it for them?”
- Protect Yourself From Bad Advice. Munger cautions us to be careful of professional advice that might be shaped by the advisor’s personal interest.
- Influence Yourself. By understanding what really drives you, you can drive yourself.

Quotes
> If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. - Ben Franklin

>Perhaps the most important rule for management is ‘get the incentives right.’-  Munger

Antidotes
- Be wary of people’s actions and behaviors.analyze the context to see if there are any ulterior motives.
- Obey Munger’s ‘Granny Rule’. Granny’s Rule is “children eat their carrots before they get dessert.” Get your hardest work done before rewarding yourself.

Example
Students who are rewarded for their hard work at school but not their test scores have higher academic achievements.

### Liking/Loving
Munger argues that we are wired to naturally favor people we like and love to the point of irrationality. In social psychology, this tendency is known as in group bias.

In order to keep liking and loving them, we do the following behaviors that we may not have done otherwise:
- Distort facts
- Ignore faults
- Comply with wishes
- Favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of affection.

We even go to great lengths in order to keep being liked and loved by others; even people we don’t know.

Quotes
> ...[Man] will generally starve, lifelong, for the affection and approval of many people
not related to him.” - Munger

Antidotes
- Be awareof how liking or loving others distorts your logic.
- When building relationships with others, do whatever you can to start the relationship off as part of the ingroup.

Examples
- If you identify as Democrat, you would find Barrack Obama more attractive than Sarah Palin and vice versa.
- In one research study, babies were shown to favor researchers of the same race.

Resource

### Disliking/Hating
The opposite of the liking/loving tendency is also true. We tend to disfavor people we already
dislike and hate to level of irrationality. This results in:
- Ignoring virtues of people we dislike.
- Disliking people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of our dislike.
- Distorting facts in order to facilitate the hatred.

Quotes
> [A] major difference between rich and poor people is that the rich people can spend their lives suing their relatives.” - Warren Buffet as quoted by Munger

> Politics is the art of marshalling hatreds.” -Anonymous

Examples
 - When the World Trade Center was destroyed, many Pakistanis immediately concluded that the Hindus did it, while many Muslims concluded that the Jews did it. - Munger
- Similarly, post 911 years saw investment fund managers with foreign sounding names experiencing reduced fund flow from investors, in comparison to counterparts with commonplace American names. In other words, before having evidence, they used the tragedy to further their pre-existing hatred.

### Doubt/Avoidance
The human brain has evolved to resolve open issues (i.e., cognitive dissonance) by making decisions. Part of our speedy decision making process comes at a price: we eliminate any potential doubts, which might cause us to make mistakes.

What normally triggers the tendency is some combination of:
1. Puzzlement
2. Stress

Quotes
> After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do. - Munger
> So pronounced is the tendency in man to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision that behavior to counter the tendency is required from judges and jurors.” Munger

Antidotes
- Force yourself to take a break and/or delay before making a decision.

Example
Toyota engineers practice a production system of delaying decisions, dubbed the second Tokyo paradox, to produce better and cheaper cars.

###  Inconsistency-Avoidance
We rarely do things that are inconsistent with our identity, beliefs, and habits. To save energy,
we are often reluctant to change our habits, especially bad ones. Such bad habits include biased thinking patterns. These patterns lead to cognitive errors, limiting our choice of actions in life.

Quotes
> When Marley’s Christmas Carol miserable ghost says, “I wear the chains I forged in life,” he is talking about chains of habit that were too light to be felt before they became too strong to be broken. - Munger

> The rare life that is wisely lived has in it many good habits maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured.” - Munger

> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. - Poor Richard’s Almanack

> One corollary of Inconsistency/Avoidance Tendency is that a person making big sacrifices in the course of assuming a new identity will intensify his devotion to the new identity (i.e., hazing at fraternities). - Munger

Antidotes
- Realize that every action you take leads to good habits or bad habits. So, endeavor to constantly be creating new, positive habits.
- Be careful about the beliefs you take on.First, find sufficient evidence to disprove your point first before believing in it. Charles Darwin “trained himself, early, to intensively consider any evidence tending to disconfirm any hypothesis of his, more so if he thought his hypothesis was a particularly good one.
- Find ways to challenge your preconceived beliefs. Elon Musk proactively seeks out ideas that challenge his existing beliefs. “At his peak, Einstein was a great destroyer of his own ideas.”

Example
Stanford professor, BJ Fogg, is one of the world’s top expert on habits. He shares that the simple act of flossing one tooth can lead to much better habits in life. Not only the small habit minimizes the resistance towards new habits caused by our inconsistency avoidance tendency it breaks the unproductive cognitive pattern we might have in our lifestyle and
helps us build bigger, better habits.

### Curiosity
Munger argues that curiosity not only counters the negative effects of our psychological tendencies, it also lets us enjoy the process of learning and acquiring knowledge.

Quotes
> Man’s curiosity, in turn, is much stronger than that of his simian relatives.- Munger

> Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition a minority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce bad consequences arising from other psychological tendencies. The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education has ended. - Munger

Example
Late MIT professor, Amar Bose, used “insatiable curiosity” to dive into subjects like nuclear physics, as well as create his audio equipment company from scratch.

### Kantian Fairness
Citing Kant and his categorical imperative, Munger argues that “reciprocal courtesy”is a societal norm, at least in United States. When we are not treated fairly, often we become very angry and/or frustrated.

In a famous Prisoner’s Dilemma experiment, when one person feels betrayed by another, that person will not act out of his/her own immediate self interest in order to punish the other person.

Quotes
> There is, in modem human culture, a lot of courteous lining up by strangers so that all are served on a “first come first served” basis.” - Munger

Example
As early as 15 months, babies can recognize the concept of fairnesswhen it comes to sharing food. In one of the tasks during the research study, babies who previously reacted to unequal food distribution shared their preferred toys with a stranger.

###  Envy/Jealousy
Munger points how out our evolutionary desire to own others’ possessions leads to worse situations like hatred, fights and so on. Abraham Tesser’s academic research on the Self Evaluation Model counterintuitively shows that our self-esteem suffers and therefore, feel the most jealous of other people when they’re:
- Close to us (ie  sibling, friend)
- Outcompeting us in areas that are important to us

Quotes
> It is not greed that drives the world, but envy. - Warren Buffet as quoted by Munger

Antidotes
- Disarmother people’s jealousy of you with vulnerability.
- Practice mindfulnesswhen you feel jealous or envious accept and appreciate your emotions. Your emotions often are telling you something about yourself, and being aware of what messages they bring can bring you new personal insights.

Example
In the Wesco Annual Meeting (2000), Munger made the following remark on the importance of being satisfied with one’s own life: “Here's one truth that perhaps your typical investment counselor would disagree with: if you're comfortably rich and someone else is getting richer faster than you by, for example, investing in risky stocks, so what?! Someone will always be getting richer faster than you. This is not a tragedy.”

### Reciprocation
We are wired to reciprocate. If people give to us, we feel we owe the other person. Similar to the fairness tendency, if someone hurts us, we feel the need to hurt them back.

Companies can use this approach to:
- Start a relationship by giving something, even if it’s small.
- Negotiate by asking for something big and unrealistic at first, and then when the person says no, ask for something that is smaller that is the ultimate thing you wanted anyway. In an experiment performed by Robert Cialdini, this approach was incredibly effective.
- Use the ‘foot in the door’ technique (a.k.a., Franklin Effect) by asking for something small that everyone will say yes to and then increase the sizes of the asks.

Quotes
> The automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and disfavors has long been noticed as it is in apes, dogs, and many less cognitively gifted animals. The tendency facilitates group cooperation for the benefit of members. - Munger

Antidotes
- Start and develop relationships by proactively giving. Most people will reciprocate.
- Wise employers, therefore, try to oppose reciprocate favor tendencies of employees engaged in purchasing. The simplest antidote works best: Don’t let them accept any favors from vendors.
- The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction. As my smart friend Tom Murphy so frequently says, ”You can always tell the man off tomorrow, if it is such a good idea.”

Example
John Corcoran, an attorney who worked as a White House speechwriter at 23 years old, shared how Bill Clinton would not only write handwritten notes to follow up with contacts, he would freely give his time to strangers at events to fulfill their various requests like autographing. By giving first, people will tend to reciprocate when you ask for favors.

### Influence-From-Mere-Association
We perceive people or things differently depending on who/what they are associated with. Advertisers have long understood this. They link their products to things that will trigger the responses they want you to have. This is also known as classical conditioning.

Sometimes when people receive a favor when they’re in pain (poor, sick, etc.), they associate the person that gave them the favor with the pain. As a result, the favor just reinforces the pain.

If we link a past event where we got lucky to skill rather than luck, then we will make poor choices about the future.

Quotes
> Advertisers know about the power of mere association. You won’t see Coke advertised alongside some account of the death of a child. Instead, Coke ads picture life as happier than reality. - Munger

> Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one’s past success, or one’s liking and loving, or one’s disliking and hating which includes a natural hatred for bad news. - Munger

> Hating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere association. In business, I commonly see people underappraise both the competency and morals of competitors they dislike. This is a dangerous practice, usually disguised because it occurs on a subconscious level.- Munger

Antidotes
- Carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental, non-causative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead as one appraises odds implicit in a proposed new undertaking.
- Look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success occurred.
- Don’t shoot the messenger make a habit of welcoming bad news to counter this tendency! “Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait.”  common injunction at Berkshire

Example
By continuously associating top athletes with its products over decades, Nike has built a global brand that is trusted by consumers. It has linked this feeling with its ‘swoosh’ logo.

### Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
We tend to distort facts for our own psychological comfort. This psychological discomfort is known as cognitive dissonance.

If we make a habit of continually avoiding information that is painful, we’ll not only develop a distorted view of reality, we’ll train other people not to tell us the truth.

Quotes
> It is not necessary to hope in order to persevere. - William the Silent

Antidote
Don’t resolve cognitive dissonance by distorting reality in order to make you feel better. Find a way to always keep yourself open to the facts of any situation so you can make the most sound choices.

Example
In the classic Aesop’s fable, the fox claimed that the grapes were sour after failing to get them in order to cope with the fact that he couldn’t reach them. A real life comparison would be the cult leader who fails to predict the end of the world time and again and each time comes up with a different excuse.

### Excessive Self-Regard
We are overconfident thinking we’re better than the average person. Several studies of self-perception, show that for any given trait, more than 50% of people think they’re above average from unsophisticated computer users who think they are cyber crime experts, to Harvard Business School students who think that they are better looking than everyone else.
This is known as the Endowment Effect. Being overconfident can lead to many shortcomings;
for example, overconfident students do significantly poorer on tests.

The result of this is overappraising things we own, decisions we make, and people like us underappraising things that challenge our self-regard.

Quotes
> Man’s excess of self-regard typically makes him strongly prefer people like himself. - Munger. This is also known as homophily.

> Even man’s minor possessions tend to be over-appraised. Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn’t already own them.” - Munger.

> A man should try to face the two simple facts:
> - Fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and tends to create more of itself causing more damage to the excuse giver with each tolerated instance.
> - In demanding places, like athletic teams and General Electric, you are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving excuses instead of behaving as you should.- Munger

Antidotes
 - Excesses of self-regard often cause bad hiring decisions because employers grossly over appraise the worth of their own conclusions that rely on impressions in face-to-face contact. The correct antidote to this sort of folly is to under weigh face-to-face impressions and over weigh the applicant’s past record.- Munger
- The main institutional antidotes to this part of the “Tolstoy effect” are:
	- Offer meritocratic, demanding culture, plus personal handling methods that build up morale, and
	- Severance of the worst offenders.” - Munger
- The best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself, your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity.
- Of all forms of useful pride, perhaps the most desirable is a justified pride in being trustworthy. Moreover, the trustworthy man, even after allowing for the inconveniences of his chosen course, ordinarily has a life that averages out better than he would have if he provided less reliability. - Munger

### Over-Optimism
We tend to be foolishly optimistic without calculating the risks. In anticipation of good future outcomes and how much control we have over them we overestimate how much control we have over them. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot’s research suggests that the optimism bias has evolved to become an integral part of the human psyche, regardless of one’s race, gender and nationality.

Two sobering examples are we are over-optimistic regarding how fast we can pay off our student debt, or how well we can use our driving skills.

Quotes
> What a man wishes, that also will he believe. - Demosthenes, the most famous Greek orator

Antidotes
One standard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high school
sophomores. - Munger

Example
The late Steve Jobs refused surgery at first when he was first diagnosed with cancer, thinking that he could beat the ailment by using alternative medicinal treatments, but none worked to his avail.

Resource

- The Munger Network Of Mental Models (page 5)

### Deprival-Superreaction
We tend to intensely react to any real loss or potential loss irrationally. This explains in fighting that occurs within bureaucracies.

Quotes
> A man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threatened loss, of property, love, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, status, or any other valued thing. - Munger

> Time and again, studies have shown that loss and the threat of it is a powerful motivation for human beings, from high stake international politics to daily consumption behavior. Examples of how we fear potential losses abound in real life: losing a coin toss, missing a shopping deal, and so on.

> Deprival Superreaction Tendency is also a huge contributor to ruin from compulsion to gamble. First, it causes the gambler to have a passion to get even once he has suffered loss, and the passion grows with the loss. Second, the most addictve forms of gambling provide a lot of near misses and each one triggers Deprival Superreaction Tendency.” - Munger

Antidotes
- One antidote to intense, deliberate maintenance of group think is an extreme culture of courtesy, kept in place despite ideological differences, like the behavior of the justices now serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. - Munger
- Another antidote is to deliberately bring in able and articulate disbelievers of incumbent group think. Successful corrective measures to evil examples of groupthink maintenance have included actions like that of Derek Bok when, as president of Harvard, he started disapproving tenure appointments proposed by ideologues at Harvard Law School. - Munger
- One of the best antidotes to this folly is good poker skill learned young. The teaching value of poker demonstrates that not all effective teaching occurs on a standard academic path. - Munger

We are wired to make a huge number of decisions in our life based purely on other people’s actions. The effect is so strong that even if we are surrounded by a small group of people who insist that blue is green, then we’ll question our own reality.

Entrepreneurs who create public social proof of their product (i.e. positive customer reviews) get more sales.

Quotes
> When will the Social Proof Tendency be most easily triggered ?Here the answer is clear from many experiments: Triggering most readily occurs in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly when both exist. - Munger

> In social proof, it not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that inaction is the right course. - Munger

> In social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that inaction is the right course. Thus, the inaction of a great many bystanders led to the death of Kitty Genovese in a famous incident much discussed in introductory psychology courses. - Munger

> Monkey see, monkey do. - Anonymous

Antidotes
- Learn how to ignore the examples from others when they are wrong, because few skills are more worth having. - Munger
- Because both bad and good behavior are made contagious by Social Proof Tendency, it is highly important that human societies:
	- Stop any bad behavior before it spreads.
	- Foster and display all good behavior.

Example
Restaurant owners should especially pay attention to the impact of customer reviews on their products, because a Harvard Business School study pointed out that “a one star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5.9% increase in revenue”, largely because customers trust other customers the most in general.

### Contrast-Misreaction
Our conscious mind is limited. Therefore, we can’t register every detail that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell in every moment. Our brain unconsciously makes choices about where our attention flows. One of the ways that it makes this decision is by sudden change. If we hear a loud sound all of a sudden, our attention immediately goes there.

This same principle applies to the world of value. We don’t measure the value of things in a vacuum. We often notice value by contrasting it with something else. Retailers take advantage of this by attaching an artificially high price to their product and then providing a significant discount.

Quotes
> The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything but the value of nothing. - Phillip Fisher

> A small leak will sink a great ship. The utility of the aphorism is large precisely because the brain so often misses the functional equivalent of a small leak in a great ship. - Ben Franklin

> Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, will often miss a trend that is destiny. - Munger

Antidotes
- Train yourself to notice small changes that other people miss. This gives you the ability to stop bad chain reactions before they spread, and invest/nurture positive ones before they spread. Most famously, Charles Darwin trained himself to meticulously track very small variations of animal features over many years. These observations ultimately led Darwin to the Theory of Evolution.
- Train yourself to make small changes to your habits. Make a micro-resolution a small, specific measurable goal that will keep you accountable on a regular basis, without triggering your Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency.

Examples
By running five minutes a day, you can reduce chances of dying prematurely by 30%.

### Stress-Influence
Some stress helps us focus, but too much destroys our decision making capabilities. Therefore, we must learn how to manage stress in situations, so that we make the best decisions possible.

In ethically questionable experiments performed by Nobel Laureate, Ivan Pavlov, where he stress-induced nervous breakdowns in dogs and tried to reverse the effects, he found:
- He could classify dogs so as to predict how easily a particular dog would breakdown.
- The dogs hardest to break down were also the hardest to return to their pre-breakdown state.
- Any dog could be broken down.
- He couldn’t reverse a breakdown except by reimposing stress.

Quotes
> ...The heavy-handed imposition of stress might be the only reversal method that would work to remedy one of the worst evils imaginable: a stolen mind. - Munger

Antidotes
- Listen to your body. When you feel persistently overwhelmed, take a step back.
- Meditate. Multiple research studies have proven that meditation is highly effective in regulating our emotions, especially our capacity to cope with stress, mainly by increasing our mindfulness towards negative emotions.
- Rest, nap, sleep. No, no skimping - your brain needs 100% of its rest time.

### Availability-Misweighing
We tend to over-emphasize information that is the most available and vivid from our surroundings and our mind. In the academic world, this is known as the Availability Bias. Unfortunately, The easiness doesn’t mean that the information is the most useful one.

This can work to people’s benefit in the world of persuasion and memory. By painting a vivid picture of something, we can more effectively influence others and keep ideas in our own memories.

When in group environments, simple explanations of complex phenomena can rapidly gain currency and spread even if they’re wrong. This is known as the availability cascade.

Quotes
> An idea or a feat is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you. - Munger

> When I’m not near the girl I love, I love the girl I’m near. - Frank Sinatra

Antidotes
- Train yourself to brainstorm all possibilitiesopenly rather than jumping on your first conclusions. Develop your strategic thinking abilities to tackle complex problems.
- Use a checklist, or procedures, to curb this tendency.
- Always look for evidence that disproves your points, and consistently do so.
- Get skeptical people on board or assign a devil advocate role to someone you trust, so that your opinions are challenged by disconfirming evidence.
- When in meetings, let other people talk first so you don’t bias how they respond.

### Authority-Misinfluence
We trust and respect leaders too much, even when they make mistakes.

We also trust leaders in areas where they are not experts. This is known as the Halo Effect.

Quotes
> Man is often destined to suffer greatly when the leader is wrong or when his leader’s ideas don’t get through properly in the bustle of life and are misunderstood. -  Munger

Antidotes
- Be careful whom you appoint to power because a dominant authority figure will often be hard to remove, aided as he will be by Authority Misinfluence Tendency. - Munger
- Use a checklist and a critical mind to counter or at least reduce the influence of authority.

### Twaddle
People tend to talk a lot about things they’re not an expert in. Be very careful of these people.

Instead, try to surround yourself with people who show restraint in sharing their opinions until they’re more proven or thought through.

Quotes
> Man, as a social animal who has the gift of language, is born to prattle and to pour out twaddle that does much damage when serious work is being attempted. Some people produce copious amounts of twaddle and others very little. - Munger

Antidotes
The principal job of an academic administration is to keep the people who don’t matter from interfering with the work of the people that do. - Caltech engineering professor

Example
David Ogilvy, one of the founding fathers in modern advertising, had this to say when it comes to hiring at his agency: “Our offices must always be headed by the kind of people who command respect. No phonies, zeros or bastards.” His wisdom in hiring talents who uphold professional integrity in the work they do is a powerful solution to the twaddle tendency a.k.a bullshit.

### Reason-Respecting
Before doing things, we love to have reasons. Therefore, when delegating things to other people, be sure to share the reasons why the task is important.

In a famous study by researcher, Ellen Langer, she showed that when asking for a favor from a stranger, simply giving a reason for the request, even if it’s artificial, greatly increases the odds of the person complying.
 
Quotes
> There is in man, particularly one in an advanced culture, a natural love of accurate cognition and a joy in its exercise. - Munger

> In general, learning is most easily assimilated and used when, life-long, people consistently hang their experience, actual and vicarious, on a latticework of theory answering the question: Why? Indeed, the question “Why?” is a sort of Rosetta stone opening up the major potentiality of mental life. - Munger

> Unfortunately, Reason Respecting Tendency is so strong that even a person’s giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with his orders and requests. - Munger

Antidotes
Keep track of the evidence for your valid beliefs so that when you explain it to others, it makes sense.

### Lollapalooza
Lollapalooza is the tendency to get extreme consequences from confluences of psychological tendencies acting in favor of a particular outcome. 

Although it is lasted last here, Munger counts it as one of the most important. This tendency works in one of two ways:
- Effects bolster each other. In the famous Milgram experiments at Stanford, test subjects devolved into terrible behavior in just a few days as a result of six tendencies being triggered at once. In Munger’s experience, when you combine two forces together, you don’t get simple addition, you get a nuclear explosion.
- Effects cancel each other out. As companies grow, they get benefits (ie economies of scale) and disadvantages (ie beauracracy). By understanding all of the biases and how they relate to each other, you will have a huge advantage in your life.

Quotes
> Life is just one damn relatedness after another. - Julian Huxley

> Everyone who has taken Pscyh 101 knows that stress makes Social Proof Tendency more powerful. - Munger

Example
A combination of factors caused Apple stock prices to go down by almost 50% in 2014.
