# If you want someone to like you, follow the formula. Frequency, proximity, duration, intensity.

The first steps are to frequently be in proximity with the person you want to like you.

People who share the same physical surroundings are more likely to be drawn to one another. So try to be around the person you want to win over as often as you are able.

Other steps in the formula are the duration and intensity of time spent with your target.

Duration is important. The more time you spend with someone, the more you’ll be able to influence them to like you.

Intensity – meaning how well one is able to satisfy another person’s psychological and/or physical needs – by offering nonverbal “friend signals.” By nodding your head and catching people’s eye on occasion.

# Nonverbal cues set the stage for a potential friendship. Eyebrows, head tilts and smiles speak volumes.

# You have to make people feel good about themselves if you want them to like you!

People tend to gravitate toward people who make them happy, because they want to give back the positive feeling that was offered to them.

A standard empathetic statement could be, “So you are having a good/bad day?”

# To enhance the potential for friendship connections, don’t forget the laws of attraction.

One of these laws is the law of similarity, which recognizes that those people who share the same principles and beliefs tend to become friends. This law works because people who are similar tend to strengthen the similar aspects they share, which promotes mutual attraction.

Similarity can be used by looking for things you have in common with the person with whom you want to have a good relationship. For instance, you might notice if your target’s clothes give away a potential shared interest, say if she is wearing a shirt with a particular sports team’s logo.

If you find a commonality, gear the conversation toward that shared interest and avoid topics you don't both seem to be interested in.

Another law is the law of curiosity, which states that when you show you are curious about a person, you automatically pique that person’s interest in you.

Curiosity is a universal human trait, and one you can use by creating a “curiosity hook” to attract your person of interest.

A third law is the law of reciprocity, which states that when someone gives you something, you are inclined to return the gesture in kind.

# Save People’s Face

As a salesman don’t say your product is better: it implies bad judgment from the customer.

By the same token, don’t build “right or wrong situations”. Ask advice instead and make them feel part of the decision-making process, which will make them feel good.

So if you found a mistake in your boss’ work don’t go there all happy and giddy thinking you can show how good you are.

Go there and say: *“I was reviewing your latest policy and noticed something. I’d like your advice on the matter*”

# Compliments

Compliments are a well-known technique [to influence people](https://thepowermoves.com/influence-summary/). Here’s how to use them:

## At the beginning

Jack Schafer says that if it’s very early in the interaction it’s safer to let them set the stage for the compliment or you will sound insincere.

> You: then you’ve been really busy lately
Her: yeah I work 60h a week last month
You: it takes a lot of dedication and determination to commit a project of that magnitude
Her: (thinking) I sacrificed a lot to get that megaproject done and I did a good job if I may say so myself

Now she’s complimenting herself AND proving herself: genius!
