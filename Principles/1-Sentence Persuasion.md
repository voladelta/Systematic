# Principle
> People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies. -- Blair Warren

## On encouraging their dreams...
Parents often discourage their children’s dreams for “their own good” and attempt to steer them toward more “reasonable” goals. And children often accept this as normal, until others come along who believe in them and encourage their dreams. When this happens, who do you think has more power? Parents? Or strangers?

## On justifying their failures...
While millions cheer Dr. Phil as he tells people to accept responsibility for their mistakes, millions more are looking for someone to take the responsibility off their shoulders, to tell them that they are not responsible for their lot in life. And while accepting responsibility is essential for gaining control of ones own life, assuring others they are not responsible is essential for gaining influence over theirs. One need look no further than politics to see this powerful game played at its best.

## On allaying their fears...
When we are afraid, it is almost impossible to concentrate on anything else. And while everyone “knows” this, what do we do when someone else is afraid and we need to get his or her attention? That’s right. We “tell” them not to be afraid and expect that to do the trick. Does it work? Hardly. And yet, we don’t seem to notice. We go on as if we’d solved the problem and the person before us fades further, and further, away. But there are those who do realize this and pay special attention to our fears. They do not tell us not to be afraid. Instead, they work with us until our fear subsides. They present evidence, they offer support, they tell us stories, but they do not tell us how to feel and expect us to feel that way. When you are afraid, which type of person do you prefer to be with?

## On confirming their suspicions...
One of our favorite things to say is, “I knew it.” There’s just nothing quite like having our suspicions confirmed. When another person confirms something that we suspect, we not only feel a surge of superiority, we feel attracted to the one who helped us make that surge come about. Hitler “confirmed” the suspicions of many Germans about the cause of their troubles and drew them further into his power by doing so. Cults often “confirm” the suspicions of perspective members by telling them that their families are out to sabotage them. It is a simple thing to confirm the suspicions of those who are desperate to believe them.

## On helping them throw rocks at their enemies...
Nothing bonds like having a common enemy. I realize how ugly this sounds and yet, it is true just the same. Those who understand this can utilize this. Those who don’t understand it, or worse, understand but refuse to address it, are throwing away one of the most effective ways of connecting with others. No matter what you may think of this, rest assured that people have enemies. All people. It has been said that everyone you meet is engaged in a great struggle. The thing they are struggling with is their enemy. Whether it is another individual, a group, an illness, a setback, a rival philosophy or religion, or what have you, when one is engaged in a struggle, one is looking for others to join him. Those who do become more than friends; they become partners.

## Example 1: The Secret
Whether or not you believe in the “Law of Attraction” - which is “the secret” referenced in the film - you can’t go wrong by setting aside your personal beliefs and studying both the film and the marketing materials behind it. Entire books could be - and I suspect will be - written about the persuasion and marketing strategies employed by those behind this film. But for the purpose of this book we will just look at those that speak to the concepts we’re covering in One Sentence Persuasion.

So, how does The Secret encourage our dreams? How doesn’t it? Virtually every message within and behind this film, addresses this need.

According to the film’s website, “This is The Secret to everything - the secret to unlimited joy, health, money, relationships, love, youth: everything you have ever wanted.”

Wow. And if your dreams go beyond material goods, no problem. In the film, Michael Beckwith tells us he has seen “kidneys regenerated” and “cancer dissolved.”

We even hear from one woman in the movie who says she cured herself of breast cancer in just 3 months by watching funny movies on TV and by visualizing herself as being healthy. She also informs us that she did this without radiation or chemotherapy.

So if you have a dream, any dream, according to The Secret, you can do it. For those who buy the message, it doesn’t get any more encouraging than that.

In addition to encouraging our dreams, The Secret goes to great lengths to help us justify our failures and confirm our suspicions.

According to the original trailer for the film, “A secret has been passed throughout the ages, known only to a fortunate few. Those who knew it, harnessed its power. They became the greatest people in history.”

Then we’re told of a man who discovered and mastered “the secret” in 1909. Businessmen “floccked to him” and they paid great amounts of money for “the secret.” And guess what? That’s right. Every one of them went on to achieve “phenomenal success.”

But then - for some unspecified reason - they decided to keep “the secret” from the public forever, while they continued to reap its benefits. Eventually, the church even discovered “the secret” and it was banned. But now, for the first time ever, “the secret” is about to be released. Wow.

True or not, that is some story. And not only is it tremendously entertaining, it secretly - no pun intended - lets us off the hook for our past failures. After all, how can anyone expect us to succeed if the very secret to success has been kept from us?

And this same idea tends to confirm what many people suspect about getting ahead in today’s world: in some way, some how, things are rigged against the common man.

There is, however, one part of The Secret that does seem to speak against what I have just said. And that’s this quote from the film:

“You are the only one who creates your reality. For no one else can think for you. No one else can do it. It is only you. Every bit of it. You.”

That seems to directly contradict my claim that The Secret justifies our failures. It appears The Secret is doing just the opposite. But is it?

If you listen to the teachers in The Secret, you will discover that even if you aren’t aware of creating your reality, there is some “unconscious” part of you that is doing it. So while you are responsible, you really aren’t. Some hidden part of you is. And if the part that is responsible is hidden from your awareness, how can you be held responsible for it?

Now, how does The Secret allay our fears? And what fears?

In the context of this film, the fears that would need to be addressed are primarily fears of one being incapable of applying “the secret.” In other words, “Sure, this stuff may work for other people, but not little old me.” Well, have no fear.

According to the film, if you put all of your intention on the things you want, the “Law of Attraction” is going to give them to you. Every time. And, in case you’re afraid there might be too much work involved, again, have no fear.

As the film tells us, “sometimes” you will have to take action. Just sometimes. Even then, if you take action the way the Universe wants you to, you’ll feel so fantastic, you’ll never want to stop. So if you’re afraid of work, don’t be, because it won’t feel like work anyway.

And finally, how does The Secret help us throw rocks at our enemies?

Well, according to the film, an “enemy” - my term, not theirs - is anyone or any thing that stands in the way of our getting what we want.

So, how are we to deal with these enemies? We are to shun them.

According to The Secret, when you encounter things you don’t want in your life, “...do not talk about them. Don’t write about them. Don’t join groups that worry about them. Don’t push against them. Do your best to ignore them.” Notice, it does not encourage you to make peace with them, to embrace them, or even to tolerate them. You are to shun them, ignore them, which, in the end, may hurt more than actually throwing rocks at them.

Again, books could be written about the persuasive techniques in the making of and marketing of this film. But one thing is clear, while there are many persuasive techniques being used, even a project of this scale didn’t stray from these basic principles. 

## Example 2: Depression, Weight Loss and Landscaping
One of the most common of our five insights is justifying the failures of others. In my Forbidden Keys to Persuasion material, I refer to this as scapegoating. While the terminology is different, the underlying principle is the same.

Here is an excerpt that illustrates the power of this insight:

Begin Excerpt

A couple of television commercials that are currently airing in the United States illustrate this point. Both of them brilliantly and ethically employ the concept of scapegoating and they do so at the very beginning of their scripts.

The first commercial, for an antidepressant medication, starts out with something like, “Feeling depressed lately? It may be the result of a chemical imbalance in your brain.”

The second commercial, one for a weight loss product, starts out like this, “If you’ve tried to lose that extra weight and have failed, it may not be your fault. It may be your metabolism.”

Can you see their use of the scapegoat principle? If you’re depressed, it may not be your fault. It might simply be a biological factor beyond your control. And if you’re overweight and have failed to slim down, it might not be your fault, but simply a problem with your metabolism! What makes the use of scapegoating in these situations ethical is that they are absolutely true statements. Depression can be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. And obesity can be caused by metabolism. What makes the use of scapegoating brilliant in these cases is that it is used immediately in their pitches and instantly offers the viewer something of value - a scapegoat for their problems. From here, the viewer is much more open to the rest of their message.

A friend of mine who is a landscaper once told me that when he first meets potential clients they are often embarrassed by the condition of their property. When he senses this, he immediately points out how many of the problems with their property are due to such things as drought conditions, bad soil conditions and the like. In other words, the condition of their property doesn’t say anything negative about the potential client. It isn’t their fault! How important is this subtle change in strategy? He told me that the number of people he secured as clients increased significantly once he realized that people often not only want their property to look nicer, but don’t want to accept responsibility for it looking poor in the first place.

End Excerpt

## Example 3: This Book
If I’ve held your attention up to this point, there’s a good reason for it. I have used the One Sentence strategy in this very book. If you read it again, you will find places where I’ve used our five insights sprinkled throughout.

However, the best example is towards the beginning. At one point, I listed each of our five insights to not only demonstrate the effectiveness of these ideas, but also to give you a sense of how powerful and transparent they can be.

Here’s how I worked each of these insights into that section, without raising an eyebrow.

The first paragraph read:

“Given the pace of today’s world, it has never been easier to be powerfully persuasive. Never. It doesn’t require good looks, a silver tongue, or infallible logic. It doesn’t require confidence, charisma, or a magnetic personality. It is a simple matter when one cuts through all the smoke. It’s cutting though the smoke that’s the hard part."

Now, in that paragraph, I am encouraging the reader’s dreams of becoming more persuasive. And, for those who have doubts about their own potential, for example, not enough confidence or charisma, I take extra steps to assure them they can do it as well.

The next paragraph read:

“In fact, if you have yet to develop your persuasive powers to the level you want, it likely has nothing “In fact, if you have yet to develop your persuasive powers to the level you want, it likely has nothing to do with you. Given the shell game of strategies and misinformation available it is a wonder we are able to still understand each other, much less persuade each other."

In that paragraph I address two of our insights. First, I justify the failure of readers for not already being persuasive enough. Second, I confirm their suspicions that much of the material out there is too complex and confusing for anyone to understand.

And the final paragraph read:

“If this barrage of techno-jargon has left you more confused than empowered, take a deep breath and relax. We’re about to take aim at this confusion, blow away the smoke, and make things as simple as possible. In fact, we’ll nail it down to a single sentence. Just 27 words. And with these words, we can work miracles. But first, we must clear away some smoke."

Here, I help allay their fears with the phrase, "Take a deep breath and relax." Then, I help them throw rocks at their enemies with the phrase, "We’re about to take aim." Also, notice my use of the term "we." I said, "We’re about to take aim." Not, "I’m about to take aim." I then said, "We must clear away some smoke." Not, "I must clear away some smoke." These subtle changes in language help assure people that I am on their side, and no one else’s.

There are two important lessons to take away from this example. First, as I said before, these insights were seamlessly integrated into this material. They do not stand out as being too obvious or too simple because they aren’t. In fact, since they don’t stand out, they are all the more powerful. And second, my use of these insights is authentic. I didn’t have to fabricate these statements to make them fit this strategy. Yes, I phrased them as I did with our insights in mind, but they remain grounded in truth, which is essential if we are to avoid getting our way but hating ourselves in the morning.

# Strategy
Validate and fascinate. ~~Correct and convince~~

# Hidden Addictions
## People need to feel needed.
Need plays a part in every relationship, whether personal or professional, and as a result, is always worthy of our consideration. Perhaps the first thing that should be pointed out is a rather obvious statement, but one that is too often overlooked, and that is that there is an enormous difference between telling others they are needed and actually making them feel they are needed. The first strategy is simple, direct, and almost never very effective. The second strategy requires more patience and finesse, but is infinitely more powerful.

And while every situation and relationship is unique, here is a 6-step process that can serve as a guideline for employing this powerful aspect of persuasion.
1. Explain the situation as a whole. What is at stake? What is the dilemma?
2. Explain the specific role the person can play in the situation.
3. Emphasize the importance of the role.
4. Point out how the person is uniquely qualified for the role.
5. Openly acknowledge that your request will require a sacrifice on their part.
6. Ask if you can count on them to help. 

## When aware of an impasse, people will do anything to gain a sense of hope.
To harness this power, we must simply stop and ask ourselves, what is it that others are frustrated with? What are the circumstances they are seeking to resolve? How will complying with our proposal help satisfy their need for hope?

The possibilities for meeting this addiction are endless and aren't difficult to employ providing that we don't overlook the need in the first place. Religions offer their followers hope for their spiritual salvation. Cults offer their followers hope for their problems. Conmen offer their victims the promise of financial gain and opportunity that will resolve their problems. What promise of hope can you offer those you wish to
persuade?

## People need a scapegoat.
When we sense that something is wrong with us, we immediately begin searching for a resolution. Why? Because something "wrong" represents a threat to our psychological stability. Things were going just fine for us and then, all of a sudden, something has changed and upset our circumstances, and until we discover the source of the problem, our psychological stability is threatened. And there is no faster way to regain the stability and sense of security we once felt than to learn that the source of our problem lies outside ourselves. In other words, our problem lies in a scapegoat.

So given this fact, how can we employ the principle without resorting to the despicable practices associated with it? Simple.

We need to realize that the scapegoat need not be another person or group. The scapegoat merely needs to be an opposing force for it to be effective. For example, it might be an idea, a philosophy, or an unfortunate set of circumstances beyond one's
control.

## People need to be noticed and feel understood.

## People need to be right.
How can we change someone's opinion on an issue and still allow the person to be right?

Here are two simple, yet profoundly effective strategies. First, set aside the issue in question without appearing to do so.

I once heard a three-hour talk radio interview with a one-time guru who was attacked by nearly every other caller. You're a conman some would complain. A scam-artist. You're getting filthy rich off your followers. Your philosophy does more harm than good. And these were some of the milder complaints. Now clearly this guru had to dispute these claims or else he would lose face in the eyes of the listening audience. But how could he do it without infuriating the callers more than they already were? He used some magic words. And those words were as follows:
> Your point is well taken. I understand your position. You bring up an important point. I'm glad you asked this question. 

He used these and other such phrases before he ever uttered a word about his own position that was in dispute.

If you look at these phrases carefully you will notice two things.
- First, they do not say the other person is wrong. Is this a minor point? Far from it. Most of us would start off with phrases such as, "I'm sorry you feel that way but you're mistaken," "You obviously haven't done your research" or maybe simply, "That's categorically not true." And with this position stated, we would have instantly created a context of dispute. You are right, the other person is wrong. The situation has now become a battle of ego and someone must lose. Oftentimes, both of you will lose.
- The second thing we will notice is that the phrases almost appear to express agreement with the other person. "Your point is well taken." What does that really mean? Nothing. But it sounds like agreement. Same with "I understand your position." This doesn't say I agree with it or that I accept it, only that I understand it. Yet, again, its effect on the listener is as if we agreed with them and their defenses immediately come down. At this point, and only at this point, is effective communication and persuasion possible.

What was the result of the guru using these phrases? Nearly every angry caller immediately calmed down and began to consider his position. Some even apologized for the misunderstanding before they ended their call. Even those who refused to back off their position seemed disoriented as the attack they were expecting never came and they ending up hanging up without effectively getting their points across.

The second way to help correct another person without making them wrong is to simply employ the power of one of our other hidden addictions in the process. If you absolutely must correct someone, and there will undoubtedly be times when you must, you can often
make the correction much more palatable by offering them a scapegoat. In other words, you let them know that even though they're mistaken, it isn't their fault.

By doing this, in effect, you aren't making the person wrong at all. You are making the other person wrong, the person from whom they got this information from in the first place. It is always much easier for us to accept that someone else is wrong than for us to have to accept that we are.

## People need to know things others don't know/things they aren't supposed to know.

Do you want to hear a secret? You're not alone. The idea of learning something few people know or something you aren't supposed to know is extremely seductive.

Many cult leaders claim to be in possession of secret knowledge. To have a direct line to God if you will. The rest of the world is woefully mistaken as to God's true plan. Only the guru can help you achieve true union with God.

Others claim to have connections to other mystical sources of wisdom. They channel spirits, they communicate with aliens, they have solved the mystery of human cloning. The power these people have is based largely on their claims to possessing secret knowledge. Knowledge that they will only reveal to you if you comply with their demands.

Con artists present secret "opportunities" to their victims that offer windfall gains if they will but act before others discover the opportunity for themselves.

The power of secrecy is all around us and just waiting to be harnessed. And while this addiction requires little explanation, it should never be far from our thoughts when trying to persuade others.

So what is it about your product, service or ideas that has an edge of secrecy to it? When you discover it, you will have discovered another powerful source for persuasion.

## People need to feel a sense of power.
It has been said that people don't resist change, they resist being changed. At the heart of this resistance is our need to feel a sense of power. When this sense is threatened, we will often resist ideas and proposals that we would otherwise gladly accept without a
moments' hesitation.

High-pressure sales tactics are one of the best illustrations of this point. We've all experienced these types of repulsive sales tactics and know better than to use them ourselves. However, unless we consciously and intentionally address the issue of power in our persuasion efforts, we run the risk of generating just such resistance without our ever realizing it.

Rather than deny the other person a sense of power or choice in your proposal, emphasize it. Make it a point that the person has the ultimate power to decide and that you won't attempt to take that away from them. The decision to join or not, to participate or not, is
theirs and theirs alone.

## Isolation
Nobel Prize winner, Elias Canetti, in his book Crowds and Power, pointed out that one of the most reliable ways of maintaining the existence of any given group of people is in focusing its members' attention on another group of people whom they see as rivals. He refers to this idea as a "double crowd." 

Specifically, he says, "Whether the two crowds confront each other as rivals in a game, or as a serious threat to each other, the sight, or simply the powerful image of the second crowd, prevents the disintegration of the first. As long as all eyes are turned in the direction of the eyes opposite, knee will stand locked by knee; as long as all ears are listening for the expected shout from the other side, arms will move to a common rhythm." 

Of course, we can detest those who employ this technique and set out to expose their methods. However, in this very act, we create an us/them dichotomy that pits the "righteous" (us) against the devious and despicable (them), and the relationships on both sides are strengthened as a result.

### Physical Isolation
A church may encourage its members to regularly volunteer for small, but essential church activities. Though church leaders can obviously ask this of their members without intending to isolate them from others, the end result is the same as if it had been done for that very purpose. That is, members that regularly volunteer tend to become more committed, and stay more committed, than members who simply attend regular church services.

Businesses who engage in smaller, but more frequent transactions with their clients often enjoy greater customer loyalty than businesses that engage in larger, but less frequent transactions. For example, we tend to be more loyal to a local grocery store or video
rental outlet than an automobile dealership.

In short, the more frequently we can get another person physically involved with us or our cause, the more we can expect their loyalty to remain intact.

### Psychological Isolation
#### Fostering and Maintaining Secrets
When group members share secrets amongst themselves a natural sense of bonding occurs. This bonding serves to promote a sense of family and commitment within the group that tends to continue even outside the presence of other members. It also serves to reduce the impact that outside influences may have on those who are "in the know".

#### Predicting the Future
Predicting the future is another common, but more subtle method of psychological isolation. Salesmen who attempt to discourage prospects from going elsewhere to do business often use this technique. When a prospect begins to show signs of going
elsewhere, a salesman may openly encourage them to do so, but then suggest they'll just be wasting their time as he then "predicts the future" by explaining what they'll find if they do check out the competition. For example, prices will be higher, selections smaller,
and terms less flexible. But by all means, feel free to find out for yourself.

If the customer decides to forgo his search, the salesman wins. If the customer decides to shop around and discovers that what the salesman said was true and returns, the salesman wins. If the customer leaves and doesn't return, the salesman is no worse off than before and at least did everything possible to maintain that customer without becoming overly forceful.

Cults use this strategy when they "predict" new recruits may experience ridicule and disbelief from those who knew them before they joined the group. This ridicule and disbelief, which would be understandable to most anyone else, is reframed by the cult leaders as "proof that their old family and friends don't understand or care for them as much as the cult does. After all, if they did care, wouldn't they be glad you found something that makes you happy?

### Cultivating Shared Experiences
Like the sharing of secrets, shared experiences are often a natural byproduct of the social process, but can also be encouraged for the express purpose of increasing a sense of bonding among group members.

Church picnics and spiritual retreats, network marketing conferences, and even high school pep rallies are just a few examples of orchestrated events designed to solidify group bonds through shared experiences.

## Gaslighting
One of the most pervasive and sensitive aspects of any relationship would have to be the issue of change. Just consider how much of our lives are spent trying to change things about other people:

We try to change the way people behave, not just toward ourselves or others, but the way they behave in general.

Stop looking at me like that when I'm trying to talk to you! I can't stand that noise you make when you eat your food! You're always late, what's wrong with you? You shouldn 't let him/her treat you like that. Why can't you be more like him/her or this, that or the other thing? Does any of this ring a bell?

According to Dr. Theo L. Dorpat in his book Gaslighting, The Double Whammy, Interrogation, and Other Methods of Covert Control in Psychotherapy and Analysis:

"Gaslighting is a type of projective identification in which an individual (or group of individuals) attempt to influence the mental functioning of a second individual by causing the latter to doubt the validity of his or her judgment, perceptions, and/or reality testing in order that the victim will more readily submit his will and person to the victimizer."

In other words, gaslighting, is what happens when others secretly try to make you doubt your ability to discern reality so that you'll come to trust their judgments more than your own.

Whatever the real reason for much of the complexity in some specialized fields of knowledge, one thing is certain. When we come to need the services of an expert, if we can't understand the exact nature of our given problem, we are at the mercy of those who do.

The point is, while there may be endless ways to establish authority and/or influence over others, at the core of most of them is a simple idea: make other people doubt their own thoughts so that they'll come to rely on yours. In other words, gaslight them.

### Repetitive questioning
Anytime we are repeatedly asked to explain something, or even just feel we are, we begin to doubt our own thinking. And the more certain we were before being questioned, the faster and more powerfully doubt can overtake us.

I once proved this point to a friend by asking him if he knew what country spaghetti and pizza originated from. When he immediately responded, Italy, I raised an eyebrow and just stared at him. After a few moments of silence, he said, "Wait a minute. You did say pizza and spaghetti, right?" I nodded. "And you wanted to know what country they came from?" I nodded again. "It's Italy," he said. When I grinned, he finally said, "Well, at least I think it's Italy."

Without saying a word, I was able to employ this technique by simply causing him to feel as if I was questioning his answer. When I failed to accept the answer he "knew" was correct, I planted a seed of doubt in his mind that caused him to question something he wouldn't have dreamed of questioning just moments before.

It is important to point out that the questioning need not be, and in fact, should not be, threatening or even challenging in nature. This would, of course, begin to generate the very resistance we are seeking to avoid. Instead, the questioning can be based out of a sense of genuine interest or a desire for clarification and still begin to generate the doubt that a more aggressive line of questioning can create.

### Pointing out the Invisible
When someone makes us aware of something we feel we should have been aware of, we tend to wonder if there is anything else we're overlooking. Our sense of certainty is suddenly gone and we become more open to the thoughts of others - especially those who were kind enough to have enlightened us in the first place.

Cult leaders employ this tactic by pointing to and exaggerating the significance of personality traits a person may have that they hadn't been aware of, or perhaps hadn't interpreted as a problem, before. But this technique is not limited to cults.

Psychotherapists often attempt to do just this when patients are locked into a given understanding of themselves and their circumstances that limits their ability to function in their lives. If the therapist can point out aspects of the situation or the patient's behavior that had not only gone unnoticed, but that casts a more empowering light on the situation, they will have gaslighted their patient and left them better off because of it.

Alluding to the Mysterious
We allude to the mysterious when we point out things another person has yet to, or may not have the ability to, see for themselves.

When a therapist tells his client that his disturbing behavior isn't due to anger but is a result of a mysterious and unconscious "complex," the patient's faith in and dependence upon the therapist grows exponentially. It's no wonder the client hasn't been able to solve his own problems. He doesn't even understand what his problems are!

The truth of the matter is that these are issues that should be considered by a prospective client, but often aren't. They are also issues that people new to the business aren't even likely to understand, much less deal with. When my clients came to understand the complexity of the production business and that I seemed to be one of the few that truly understood the complexities, I found myself losing fewer and fewer clients. And as a side benefit, I found I gained even more respect from those I dealt with.

People who allude to the mysterious tend to become trusted translators in our lives, a role that has enormous power. Gurus who claim access to desirable, but esoteric wisdom can enslave people who desperately want to know. Spiritual leaders who claim to have special insight into scripture can exert a powerful influence over their followers who come to believe there must be more to the word of God than the average person can understand. The same is true of doctors, lawyers, accountants, consultants and experts of all types - if they understand this concept.

It is difficult to overstate the power one can attain over others by simply alluding to the mysterious, and developing a reputation as a trusted translator.

### Revealing the Secret Thoughts of Others
If there is one thing that is more disturbing than finding out another person thinks poorly of us, it is finding out that others secretly share the same opinion. There may be no more powerful way to make sure our opinion impacts another person as to claim that others share the same opinion but are reluctant to admit it. You not only establish yourself as being the only one who cares enough to tell them the truth, but you drive a wedge between your target and the those who may or may not harbor secret thoughts about them.

My wife and I have often used this technique with our children. When my son recently brought home his first straight-A report card, my wife and I were ecstatic and openly expressed how proud we were of him. But rather than leave it at that, a few days later I "revealed" his mother's secret thoughts to him in order to drive the
point home even harder. As I put him to bed, I told him once again how proud I was of him for getting such good grades. When he shrugged off my comment, I looked directly at him and said, "Do you have any idea how many people your mother has told about  your grades? She's been bragging about how smart you are to everybody. I don't think she wanted to tell you she was doing that because she thought you'd get embarrassed. I just thought you should know how proud she is of you." You couldn't have pried the
smile off his face with a crowbar. And the best part was, everything I told him was true. But by revealing it to him second-hand, it took on increased importance.

### Gang Up On Them
Establish your credibility before your credibility comes into question. Demonstrate how happy your clients are with your work before you attempt to pitch your services. Stress the number of people who already support your candidate before you ask for their
support.

How do we do these things? While each situation is unique and requires its own strategy, the fundamental principle is to change the very nature of your encounters to a benign or at least, off topic, subject until your important points have been established.

## Psychological Ventriloquism
### Self-Restraint
Self-restraint is perhaps the most important personal quality we can develop in order to employ psychological ventriloquism. Why is this so important? Because without self-restraint we tend to be too direct, too blunt, too mater-of-fact about our communication.

We tell our spouses we love them, and expect them to feel loved. We tell our clients we appreciate them and expect them to feel appreciated. And we fill our ads with impressive sounding information about our products and services and expect our clients to be
impressed. While this is certainly the fastest way to express our thoughts, that is all we are doing - expressing our thoughts, as in getting them out of our heads and off our conscience. We did what we felt we needed to do and we can move on to the next order
of business. Unfortunately, we often don't recognize that in the process we have somehow failed to actually communicate the information to the other person. They don't come away feeling loved, appreciated or impressed. They come away feeling "talked at"
rather than communicated with.

### Saying versus Conveying Information
If we are to maximize the impact our communication will have on others we must break our communication into two different categories. Information we can "say" versus information we must "convey".

For example, if you tell me your business is located ten miles north of town and has been in operation for over twenty years, I will probably believe you without giving it a second thought. If you tell me your business provides the finest service of its kind and will dedicate itself to my needs, I'll probably dismiss it as fluff. Both statements were direct, so why the difference in response? In the first case, you are communicating a verifiable, non-controversial fact, so I'm apt to accept it. However, your second statement is really an opinion. Your opinion. And being the "rational" being I am, I like to form my own
opinions, thank you very much. In fact, I might not only dismiss your opinion, but depending on the circumstances, might also resent your trying to force it on me.

How can one convey he or she is an expert without coming right out and saying it?

Joe Sugarman, one of America's top copywriters and entrepreneurs, occasionally includes seemingly out-of-place technical information in his ads. While this information is often over the heads of his readers, it is placed there for just that reason. In his brilliant book, Advertising Secrets of the Written Word, Sugarman writes:

"Providing a technical explanation which the reader may not understand shows that we really did our research and if we say it's good, it must be good. It builds confidence in the buyer that he or she is indeed dealing with an expert."

Given the extensive research Sugarman conducts, he could rightly, honestly and directly tell his reader's he's an expert. But why say it and risk resistance when he can convey it and allow his readers to arrive at the conclusion themselves?

How about trying to convey one's level of commitment to a client without coming right out and saying it?

I once heard of a company that provides its sales force with mobile phones, not to use for making calls, but to use for making a point. Each salesperson is instructed to openly turn his mobile phone off and place it in his briefcase shortly after beginning a meeting with a
prospect. Rather than saying he's committed, the salesman conveys it by openly shutting off communication with the outside world and then turning his attention to the prospect.

How do we go about determining what is best said and what is best conveyed?

One of the best ways of analyzing our communication is to consider it along two different dimensions. First, the quality of the information. That is, is it objective or subjective? Fact or opinion? The second aspect to examine is the issue of resistance. How likely is it that it will be accepted or rejected by the other party?

If our communication supports someone's current mindset or promises to fulfill a need they currently feel, our "facts" are more likely to be perceived as "facts". If our communication works against them in some way, our most undeniable facts will quickly be perceived as mere opinions, falsehoods, or worse yet, completely misinterpreted by our prospects. In other words, resistance plays an important role not only in the process or persuasion, but in the process of perception as well.

### Learning from the Masters
The triggers that cause us to make the assumptions we do are dynamic and subject to an untold number of influences such as our personal histories, our intentions and desires, our immediate circumstances and the like. This is the reason that "formulas" like the ones Steve Allen was talking about earlier are so fruitless in producing powerful communication.

In his fascinating book, Which Lie Did I Tell? More Adventures in the Screen Trade, William Goldman discusses a brief portion of a screenplay by Raymond Chandler. The scene, which he offers as an example of great screenwriting, is as follows:
FADE IN ON
- A married couple in an elevator. They stand silently. The man wears a hat.
- The elevator stops.
- A pretty young woman gets in.
- The man takes off his hat.

That's it. That's the entire scene. Do you see why Goldman thinks it is such a wellwritten scene? I didn't the first time I read it. In a moment, I'll let Goldman explain for himself, but first, take a look at the scene again and try to uncover its magic.
FADE IN ON
- A married couple in an elevator. They stand silently. The man wears a hat.
- The elevator stops.
- A pretty young woman gets in.
- The man takes off his hat.

Did you catch it that time? If you did, you're doing better than most because the magic is just below the surface. Goldman explains it this way: "With that shot, you know everything. You know it's a crappy marriage, you know he wants better, you know there is sexual energy in that rising room now. And you can do that in what, ten seconds?"

I believe what Goldman is saying is that in no time at all, the writer was able to communicate a world of information about the characters, their relationship, and their circumstances, simply by showing a man removing his hat for a stranger but not his own wife. For screenwriters I can see how this would be important. But for those of us who wish to increase our understanding of human nature, it is powerful almost beyond belief.

There are two fascinating things we can learn from this scene if we but take a moment to consider it. First, in reality, the writer didn't "communicate a world of information" - we  did. The writer simply wrote 32 words on apiece of paper. That's it. Nothing more. We read these 32 words and added everything else to them, our assumptions about the characters, their relationships, their circumstances, everything.

And second, the screenwriter knew exactly how we would fill in the blanks. While it appears we have a choice in the matter, and perhaps even in theory we do, in reality, we don't. No, the screenwriter isn't putting a gun to our heads and forcing us to make any given interpretation. He is simply presenting information in a way that he knows will lead us to interpret things a certain way: his way. He controlled what we were thinking. This is the real secret behind the magic of this scene. This is the essence of psychological ventriloquism. And this is what makes studying dramatic, comedic and other forms of entertainment one of the most powerful ways we can develop this skill.

The man behind the Daisy ad mentioned earlier, media expert Tony Schwartz, says in his book The Responsive Chord, "A listener or viewer brings far more information to the communication event than a
communicator can put into his program, commercial, or message. The communicator's problem, then, is not to get stimuli across, or even to package his stimuli so they can be understood and absorbed. Rather, he must deeply understand the kinds of information and experiences stored in his audience, the patterning of this information, and the interactive resonance process whereby stimuli evoke this stored information."

There is no more powerful skill we can learn than to give others the illusion of choice while predetermining that which they can choose.

People sometimes believe what they are told, but never doubt what they conclude.

### Example 1
Some psychics will set up mysterious and almost religious looking props around their tables in order to instill a sense of respect in their customers. Some palm readers use expensive looking magnifying glasses and consult convoluted charts and graphs, not to provide a more accurate reading, but to lead their customers to have a greater belief in the legitimacy of their services. And, of course, our churches needn't do much more than burn incense, play their organs and surround themselves with stained glass to lead us to accept their structures as holy.

These people don't have to tell us how they want us to think. All they have to do is use the triggers we have been conditioned to accept as signs of legitimacy and we will gladly, and unconsciously, do the rest.

### Example 2
A client visits a psychotherapist who specializes in Brief Therapy - a form of therapy that, as the name implies, attempts to compress the therapy process into as short a time as possible. In this case, the therapist tells his client that their time together will be restricted to no more than ten sessions. Upon hearing this, the client expresses concern than his problem is too complicated to be resolved in just ten sessions. The therapist knows that the client's concern is unfounded and yet, cannot directly tell the client this without invalidating the client's belief and damaging their rapport. How can the therapist get the patient to change his mind without making him wrong?

"Given the length of time you've had this problem, and the failure of your previous therapy, obviously it is a very difficult, very serious, very tenacious problem so it's likely you will require all ten sessions"

With that one response, the therapist has not only agreed with the patient that his concern is valid, but also made his client believe that ten sessions was no longer brief therapy, but in a way, long term therapy.

### Example 3
An ad agency is going broke due to having too few clients. The word is out that the firm is going under. How do those involved convince others in their industry, in the media and especially their potential clients that the firm is still viable and worth hiring? How do they turn it all around before it's too late?

Do they lower their prices in an effort to expand its client base? Do they take out ads or issue press releases explaining their credentials and highlighting their past successes? Do they psych themselves up and hit the streets in a last ditch effort to round up clients? No. They decide to throw a party and as a result, save their firm.

This is the situation painted by Jurgen Wolff in his excellent book Do Something Different - Proven Marketing Techniques to Transform Your Business. The situation and result are both true.

As Wolff points out, the owner of the agency, Jerry Delia Femina, spent everything he had left throwing a lavish Christmas party for competitors, potential clients and journalists in an effort to make them see the firm as a success. What was the result? According to Wolff, "The party had the desired effect. Wanting to be part of such an obviously successful new venture, several clients signed up immediately, and the agency went on to great success."
