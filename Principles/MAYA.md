> Most Advanced Yet Acceptable - Raymond Loewy

It is something new, challenging, or surprising that
opens a door into a feeling of comfort, meaning, or familiarity. It is called an "aesthetic aha". ==Same same but different==.

## Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do
The most successful artists and entrepreneurs tend to be geniuses. But ==the paradox is that they are both smarter than their median consumer and dumber than all of their consumers== because they don’t know how their consumers live, what they do every day, what annoys them, or what moves them. If familiarity is the key to liking, then ==people’s familiarities — the ideas, stories, behaviors, and habits with which they are fluent — are the keys to their heart==. 

Loewy had his own theories of beauty, his eggshells and his chrome finishes. But he knew that designing for strangers was, at the beginning, like fumbling through a dark tunnel toward a tiny speck of light. He was obsessed with understanding the people he was designing for.

## To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising, make it familiar.
At the far reaches of radical thinking, it’s critical for artists and entrepreneurs with wild ideas to heed the pull of familiarity and remember Max Planck’s warning: Even the most brilliant scientific breakthroughs face initial skepticism when they are too far from mainstream thought. Great art and products meet audiences where they are.

But the fact that people gravitate to fluency in art and design is no excuse for dumb simplicity. The central insight of MAYA is that ==people actually prefer complexity — up to the point that they stop understanding something==. Many of today’s museumgoers don’t just stare at the water lilies. They enjoy strange and abstract art that gives them a feeling or a jolt of meaning. TV viewers don’t just watch reruns. They like complex mysteries with narrative puzzles that come to completion. Theatergoers love familiar revivals, but the most influential Broadway smash hits are ones, like Hamilton, that tell a familiar story in an ingeniously new way. The power of fluency, after all, is strongest when it emerges from its opposite, a challenging period of disfluency, to create an aha moment.

## People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love it. 
Loewy and his ilk were constantly pushing tastes forward among an audience of midcentury Americans who didn’t know they wanted anything new. In the final pages of his memoir, Loewy relays an old joke about a Boy Scout and his scoutmaster discussing the day’s mandatory Good Deed.
> “And what good have you done today, Ray?”
> “Walter, Henry, and I helped a lady across the street,” the boy says.
> “Very nice. But why did it take three of you?”
> “The old lady did not want to cross.”

## Repetition and rhythm
Favreau, a self-taught pianist who studied classical music in college, delights in the comparison of his work to pop song writing. “A good line in a speech is like a good piece of music,” he said. “If you take a small thing and repeat it throughout the speech, like a chorus in a song, it becomes memorable. People don’t remember songs for the verses. They remember songs for the chorus. ==If you want to make something memorable, you have to repeat it==.”

> Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Tell them. Tell them what you told them.

When they worked together on the most important addresses, Obama and Favreau would ask: “What’s the ‘spine’ of this speech?”. The spine was the hook, the theme, or the rhetorical chorus that held a speech together. Using the concept of the ‘American Promise’, in the official transcript of the speech, Obama repeats the word “promise” thirty-two times.

==Repetition is the god particle of music==. Repetition redirects attention to the sound of speech itself — the pitch of the voice, the rhythm of the stops, the secret melodies of conversation. The speech-to-song effect is considered an illusion, but if there is a hidden melody embedded in all language, then it’s cacophony that is the illusion. The strange truth is that all speech is composed of microscopic melodies and undiscovered songs. It just takes a little repeating to hear the music.

A cousin of the “speech-to-song” illusion is the “rhyme-as-reason” effect. Just as repetition of words can create the illusion of singing, musical language can create the illusion of rationality. Studies show that people consider rhyming quips — like “What sobriety conceals, alcohol reveals” or “Woes unite foes” — more accurate than their nonrhyming versions—like “What sobriety conceals, beer unmasks”. ==Repetition and rhythm are like flavor enhancers for language==: They can make bad ideas seem extraordinarily clever, because listeners don’t think too hard when they hear pretty words. They often just assume the words are true.

It would seem that the key to catchy writing is simple. Just write in pairs. Or, to honor Carnegie’s legacy: “To be remembered, be repetitive.” Or if that’s not sticky enough, invoke the rhyme-as-reason effect: “To write a line that people use, make your idea break in twos.”

There is good and bad in this. By turning arguments into spoken music—and making poetry out of policy—antimetabole and its cousins can make important and complicated ideas go down easily. But they can also wave a magic wand over frivolous and dubious ideas, turning something questionable into something catchy.

Example:
- “Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”
- “Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.”
- On winning arguments: “If you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.”
- “To be interesting, be interested.”
- “Man is not the creature of circumstances. Circumstances are the creatures of men.” —Benjamin Disraeli
- “East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed; we are armed because we mistrust each other.” —Ronald Reagan
- “The world faces a very different Russia than it did in 1991. Like all countries, Russia also faces a very different world.” —Bill Clinton
- “Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.” —George W. Bush
- “Human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights.” —Hillary Clinton

## Viral
 Almost all popular products and ideas have blockbuster moments where they spread from one source to many, many individuals *at the same time*.
 
The information cascade looks more like **a bomb fuse** — a quiet string of solitary shares followed by several explosions, in the form of celebrity tweets. 

Where one Facebook post, one favorable spot on the Drudge Report, or one well-watched segment on Fox News reaches thousands and thousands of people *instantaneously*, and then a small fraction of that infected group **passes it along again**.

Almost nothing really goes viral, but some ideas and products really are more infectious than others. They are shared and discussed at *higher-than-average rates*. But to go big, they need that broadcast to push them into the mainstream, where people will find them and share them.

For many cultural achievements, the art itself is not the only thing worth consuming; the experience of having seen, read, or heard the art for the purpose of being able to talk about it is its own reward. Such consumers are not just buying a product; what they’re really buying is entry into a popular conversation. ==Popularity is the product==.

## Audience
> To make popular content, it’s not enough to know your friends or your followers. It’s about knowing the friends of your friends and the followers of your followers. For something to go big, it has to be interesting to those beyond your immediate audience — *the audience of your audience*. - Jure Leskovec

If we share information with the people we’re connected to, another way to ask the question, Why do people share what they share? is to ask, ==What connects people?==

> The best jokes are so specific that they feel private. It’s that surprise, I think, that people like — that I shared something that felt almost too small and personal for anybody else to know. ==The jokes served as a small way to communicate kinship==. - Vincent Forrest

Among the most established and consistent principles in the organization of humans is an idea called “homophily.” It’s a funny-looking word that communicates a simple idea: You are like the people around you — your friends, your spouse, your online networks, and your office relationships. There is a related idea, “propinquity,” which says you are fond of, and become similar to, the people you see many times, often because they live or work nearby.

Together, they are like the social dimensions of fluency and the mere exposure effect. We’ve seen how individuals gravitate toward the familiar and become products of their environment. Groups of people are the same way. It’s exhausting to have to constantly explain oneself and face confrontation. It is deep and lovely to be near people who seem to understand us.

Stanford’s Leskovec says there are 2 basic feedback loops in every social circle:
- Sorting - People seek out others who are like them. 
- Socializing - Individuals change to become more like the group around them.

> Ideas spread most reliably when they piggyback off an existing network of closely connected and interested people. In other words, if you’re trying to attract groups, find common points of origin. - Watts’s and Leskovec’s rules for popularity

The most important element in a global cascade isn’t magically viral elements or mystical influencers. Rather it is about finding a group of people who are easily influenced. It turns the influencer question on its head. Don’t ask, “Who is powerful?” Instead ask, “==Who is vulnerable?==”

> [[Vulnerability]] is the core of all emotions.

> When I’m doing my job well, I’m saying something precise that is specific enough that it feels personal and relatable to others with the same interests. - Vincent Forrest

Simply knowing that we’re talking to a large audience shapes the information we share and how we describe what we know:
- Publicly, people often talk about issues. Privately, they talk about schedules.
- Publicly, they deploy strategic emotions. Privately, they tend to share small troubles. 
- Publicly, they want to be interesting. Privately, they want to be understood.

The world isn’t a uniformly connected glob of people. ==It’s still a billion clusters, cliques, and cults==. What Watts sees in his models, what Wolfe sees in her apps, and what Forrest sees in his customers, is that successful creations grow most predictably when they tap into a small network of people who do not see themselves as mainstream, but rather bound by **an idea or commonality that they consider special**. People have all day to talk about what makes them ordinary. It turns out that **they want to share what makes them weird**.

The paradox of scale is that the biggest hits are often designed for a *small but well-defined group of people*. Narrowly tailored hits are more likely to succeed, perhaps both because of their inherent qualities — they are focused works — and because of their network qualities.

The bottom line is content that resonates and goes viral also has another thing in common — **that it sparks conversation and allows people to engage with each other.**
 
# The Creative process
1. Define the problem
The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.
Creating behavioural objectives can help to focus ideas. Will Collin, one of the founders of Naked, explains it well. He pointed out that the business objective might be to sell 15 per cent more mayonnaise but that phrasing it as ‘getting people to try mayo on their fries’  will be far more inspirational for creating solutions.

2. Frame the metaphor, extract the abstraction, look for patterns
Abstract things out of the specific into the general, and where else these patterns may have been implemented. This framing then allows for the next stage, finding the right inspiration and outspiration, from different times, places, categories and so on.

3. Iteration, inspiration and outspiration
The components of new ideas are always other ideas. I think of them as pieces of Lego. You can make anything out of Lego, but in order to make specific things, you need specific pieces. Looking at the most successful attempts to solve similar pattern problems in the past is the first place to look for ideas that can be evolved or iterated.

4. Recombination: blend and blend again

5. Incubation: stop thinking, distract yourself, get out of your groove

6. Articulation and judgement: is it good? Will it blend further? How is it to be articulated?
Ideas are fragile, the best must be protected beyond gestation or they wither and die. Once the most fruitful ideas are selected, based on how well they seem to solve the problem and how non-obvious they are, the ideas can be nurtured into existence. 
As Shakespeare observed, ideas need names and a ‘local habitation’. A look and feel, an elevator description, a key visual in context, all help ideas come to life. Usually it is the ideas with names and contexts that stand out to the creative director, to the client and to the world at large.

# Ideavirus Tactics
 - Make it virusworthy.
If it’s not worth talking about, it won’t get talked about.

- Identify the hive.
You won’t get the full benefit of the ideavirus until you dominate your hive.

- Expose the idea.
Expose it to the right people, and do whatever you need to do to get those people deep into the experience of the idea as quickly as possible. Pay them if necessary, especially at the beginning. NEVER charge for exposure if you can help it.

- Figure out what you want the sneezers to say.
You’ve got to decide what you want the sneezers to say to the population. If you don’t decide, either they’ll decide for you and say something less than optimal, or they won’t even bother to spend the time.

- Give the sneezers the tools they need to spread the virus.
After you’ve got a potential sneezer, make it easy for him to spread the idea. Give him a way to send your idea to someone else with one click. Let me join your affiliate program in sixty seconds or less. Reward the people I spread the virus to, so I don’t feel guilty for spreading it.

- Once the consumer has volunteered his attention, get permission.
The goal of the ideavirus marketer is to use the virus to get attention, then to build a more reliable, permanent chain of communication so that further enhancements and new viruses can be launched faster and more effectively, under your control this time.

- Amaze your audience so that they will reinforce the virus and keep it growing
Where are the Cabbage Patch Kids? Why do some viruses burn out more quickly than others? The simplest reason is that marketers get greedy and forget that a short-term virus is not the end of the process, it’s the beginning. By nurturing the attention you receive, you can build a self reinforcing virus that lasts and lasts and benefits all involved.

- Admit that few viruses last forever. Embrace the lifecycle of the virus.
Cats was a terrific success on Broadway. But even great shows don’t last forever. By understanding that the needs of the virus change over time (and that the benefits received change as well) the marketer can match expenditures to the highly leveraged moments.
