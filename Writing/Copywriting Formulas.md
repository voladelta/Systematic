## Problem – Agitate – Solve
State a problem. Your audience probably has no shortage of them.

Agitate that problem. Rub salt in the wound.

Roll out the solution. This is where you ride in with the solution, and the crowd goes (metaphorically, at least) wild.

Example: Your car won’t start. You’ve got an appointment in 15 minutes. Call Cool Cabs.

## Before After Bridge

Before – Here’s your world …

After – Imagine what it’d be like, having Problem A solved …

Bridge – Here’s how to get there.

Describe a problem, describe a world where that problem doesn’t exist, then explain how to get there. It’s a super simple setup, and it can work for blogpost intros, social media updates, email, and anywhere else that you write (or speak, for that matter).

Example: Stuck scheduling social media manually? There has to be a better way. Enter CoSchedule.

## 4P’s
Picture. Set the scene. On social media, you can do this literally with your post image.

Promise. Commit to giving your readers something they’re interested in.

Prove. Then, prove you can deliver on that promise.

Push. Next, give them a subtle shove to click and take the next step.

Example: Your marketing. Less hassle. How? Try CoSchedule free for 14 days.

## 4 U’s
Useful – Be useful to the reader

Urgent – Provide a sense of urgency

Unique – Convey the idea that the main benefit is somehow unique

Ultra-specific – Be ultra-specific with all of the above

Example: Webinar Wednesday: Answer all your questions about SEO, no matter how long it take. Here the link.

## Open Loops
Don’t tell all of the story in one post. Instead, create a gap that builds suspense using “open loops.” This entails giving people a hint about the beginning and the end, while leaving readers curious about how you got from point A to point B.

According to Zeigarnik Effect, We remember better that which is unfinished or incomplete. We seek closure as release from tension.

Example: 
- This dog is stuck on the roof. How he got there is the real story.
- Antwerp, Belgium, is no longer the diamond capital of the world.
- What a Drunk Swiss Guy Can Teach You About Handling Criticism.
