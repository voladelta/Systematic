## Definition
Metaphors constitute the essence of our “mindscape”. They help us to describe what we think, feel, hear, say and do in a way that is deeper, richer, and more impactful fashion. Metaphors also help to drive human behaviours and add colour to our world.

> According to Aristotle, the ability to see one thing as another is the only truly creative human act. Most of us have the creative spark to make metaphors, we just need to train ourselves a bit and direct our energy properly.

Essentially, a metaphor works by revealing some third thing that two ideas share in common. One good way of finding metaphors is by asking these two questions:
- What characteristics does my idea have?
- What else has those characteristics?

Answering the second question usually releases a veritable flood of possible metaphors.

Often, the relationship between two ideas is not clear. *Muhammad Ali* is hardly the first idea that comes to mind with *avalanche*, unless you recognize their linking term, *power*. In most contexts, *Muhammad Ali* and *avalanche* are non-diatonic, unrelated to each other. Only when you look to find a link do you come up with *power*, or *deadly*, or *try to keep quiet when you're in their territories*. 

Like musical notes, words can group together in close relationships, like belonging to the same key. Call this a diatonic relationship. For example, here are some random words that are diatonic to (in the same key as) *tide: ocean, moon, recede, power, beach*.

This is “playing in the key of tide,” where tide is the fundamental tone. This is a way of creating collisions between elements that have at least some things in common — a fertile ground for metaphors. There are many other keys tide can belong to when something else is a fundamental tone — for example, power. Let's play in its key: Muhammad Ali, avalanche, army, Wheaties, socket, tide.

All these words are related to each other by virtue of their relationship to “power.” If we combine them into little collisions, we can often discover metaphors:
- Muhammad Ali avalanched over his opponents.
- An avalanche is an army of snow.
- This army is the Wheaties of our revolution.
- Wheaties plug your morning into a socket.
- A socket holds back tides of electricity.

Try playing in the key of moon: stars, harvest, lovers, crescent, astronauts, calendar, tide.
- The New Mexico sky is a rich harvest of stars.
- Evening brings a harvest of lovers to the beach.
- The lovers' feelings waned to a mere crescent.
- The crescent of human knowledge grows with each astronaut's mission.
- Astronauts' flights are a calendar of human courage.
- A new calendar washes in a tide of opportunities.

There are three types of metaphor:

An **expressed identity** metaphor asserts an identity between two nouns (e.g., fear is a shadow, a cloud is a sailing ship). Expressed identity metaphors come in three forms:
- “x is y” (fear is a shadow)
- “the y of x” (the shadow of fear)
- “x's y” (fear's shadow)

Run each of these through all three forms:
- wind = yelping dog
- wind = river
- wind = highway

Now come up with a few of your own, and run them through all three forms. You might even try extending them into longer versions (e.g., clouds are sailing ships on rivers of wind).

A **qualifying metaphor** uses adjectives to qualify nouns, and adverbs to qualify verbs. Friction within these relationships creates a metaphor (e.g., hasty clouds, to sing blindly).

A **verbal metaphor** is formed by conflict between the verb and its subject and/or object (e.g., clouds sail, he tortured his clutch, frost gobbles summer down).

> Deep metaphors are basic frames or orientations we have toward the world around us. They are “deep” because they are largely unconscious and universal. They are “metaphors” because they recast everything we think about, hear, say, and do. Because deep metaphors shape the way we engage the world, an understanding of them is necessary to explain why we think and act as we do. – Gerald and Lindsay Zaltman

## Balance
This covers ideas of harmony, equilibrium, adjustment and the maintenance and offsetting of forces. Examples cover physical, moral, social, aesthetic and social balance.

An example of how balance can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

## Transformation
This involves a changing state or status, eg “turning over a new leaf”, children putting on makeup to play adult roles. They can be both positive (marriage) or negative (death).

An example of how transformation can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:
![Premier’s ad focuses on “Transformation” as a metaphor](https://coolerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transformation-in-Advertising-PRemier-768x500.jpg)

## Journey
As the saying goes, life is a journey. Confucius has famously said that “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”

Journeys can be both predictable and unpredictable, can be fast or flow (“time flies”), and both uphill and downhill.

An example of how journey can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

![Louis Vuitton’s ad above focuses on “Journey” as a metaphor](https://coolerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Journey-in-Advertising-Louis-Vuitton-Ad-768x498.jpg)

## Container
This metaphor looks at either keeping things in or keeping them out, becoming a form of protection or trap. We can be in a good or bad mood, stuck in a rut, store up our money, energy, and goodwill. Memories form one of the most vital containers for many of us.

An example of how container and journey can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

![What are the metaphors in this advertisement?](https://coolerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Container-and-Journey-in-Advertising-KBC-Insurance.jpg)

## Connection
Another universal deep metaphor, one which looks at feelings of belonging or exclusion. One can be connected to friends through social networks, and feel disconnection when losing a job, sending kids to college and so on.

An example of how connection can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

![AT&T’s ads showcase how “Connection” can be used as a metaphor](https://coolerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Connection-example-in-advertising-ATT.jpg)

## Resource
Other than the more obvious food, water, money and fuel, resources may also be our friends or family members. Just think of Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” or the well-worn expression “a friend in need is a friend indeed”. One may also be a “walking encyclopedia” or “Mr Fixit”.

An example of how resource and container can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

![This advertisement uses the deep metaphors of resource and container](https://coolerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Example-of-Marketing-Metaphor-768x1024.gif)

## Control
Now control doesn’t merely apply to those in power and authority. Rather, everyone of us need some degree of control.

When people succumb to a disease, they feel “powerless”. Social norms may also dictate how people should behave, and losing control often denotes having a meltdown, throwing a tantrum or blowing our stack.

An example of how control (or the lack of control) can be conveyed in advertising is shown below:

## Other Deep Metaphors
Other than the seven metaphors (kind of like Seven Giants or the Seven Dwarves in Snow White), other “lesser” deep metaphors include the following:

- Movement/Motion: These are quite self-evident, and can be useful in marketing messages for products that helps one to move “upwards” in life. 
- Force: Another popular deep metaphor, where notions of power or strength may be conveyed. 
- Nature: A popularly used deep metaphor, especially for health or fitness related products and services. 
- System: Commonly used by technology services and B2B solution providers.

These metaphors, like the ones above, are discerned through deep questioning and interview methods. They involve trained facilitators who are able to use visual aids to paint vivid pictures and descriptions of consumer’s thoughts, feelings and perspectives on various consumption scenarios.

## Workable Wondering
To leverage on deep metaphors in consumer insight reports, marketing communication materials, products/services, and brands, the Zaltmans propose that one could adopt a strategy for “workable wondering”.

In order to meet the customer’s personal values and life goals, you should develop product attributes that have functional and emotional consequences (psychological and social) that are seen to be aligned to those metaphors. When you do so, consider the personal and social relevance of your messages vis-à-vis that of your target audiences, and how they can be shaped to fit how they think and feel.

Like any other competitive strategy, the authors have also proposed that companies should focus on deep metaphors that are not already “owned” by a competitor. In other words, if every car company in the world are using “container” or “movement/motion” as deep metaphors, you could perhaps use “connection” or “transformation” as ways to promote your vehicle.

Finally, focus is a key virtue here. You should not go overboard in trying to be all things to all men in your use of metaphoric language and approaches.

## Terms and devices
- Allegory: The communication of something about life through symbolic figures and events, such as in narrative; an extended metaphor that uses a story to make a point.

- Analogy: Recognition that the relationship between two things is similar to the relationship between two other things (“flurries” is to “blizzard” as “candlelight” is to “klieg light”/increasing intensity); making an inference of similarity, or noting the correspondence, between two things based on shared characteristics, such as describing how the structure of an essay is like that of a sandwich.

- Anthropomorphism: The attribution of human characteristics to something that is not human, such as “shouldering a burden, going belly up, cups have lips, combs teeth, and fixtures knuckles”.

- Antithesis: The direct opposite of something; the contrasting of ideas “by means of parallel arrangements of words, clauses, or sentences (as in . . . ‘they promoted freedom and provided slavery’”).

- Conceit: A specific, innovative thought; an elaborate metaphor.

- Euphemism: The substitution of something agreeable or tolerable to the listener or reader when communicating an idea or message that is not as agreeable or tolerable, such as telling students they have “a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate their advanced knowledge” when we announce that they will have a test on Friday.

- Hyperbole: An exaggeration, such as, “It was a mountain of food!”

- Idioms: A statement of two or more words that is uniquely understood by the participants in a conversation. The general meaning of the statement cannot be discerned from the literal meaning or application of the words involved, such as when describing a classroom as a “three-ring circus” or when describing a large work project as “having my job cut out for me.” Interestingly, Sam Glucksberg (2001) notes while analyzing the idiom “kick the bucket” that we learn idioms whole, but we can be flexible in their applications and structures as long as we have key anchor points in the mapping. For example, we can say “kick the proverbial bucket”; “he’ll be kicking the bucket soon”; or “he didn’t kick the bucket, he nicked it slightly.”

- Irony: A surprise or unexpected outcome, sequence, or thought; “the use of words to express something other than the opposite of the literal meaning”. Examples: “The silence was deafening.” “The sea snake drowned.” “The economic advisor filed for bankruptcy.”

- Metaphor: A term or description that substitutes “one kind of object or idea . . . in place of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them”; a symbol.

- Metonymy: The use of part of a topic to reference or stand for that topic. Kovecses says, “Conceptually, it can be defined as the process of using a part of a domain to represent the whole domain, or aspects of a domain to implicate either the whole domain or subsections of it . . . such as ‘I’ve got a new set of wheels,’ ‘We need new blood in this organization,’ ‘Get your butt over here!’ ‘The Milwaukee Brewers need a stronger arm in right field’.

- Onomatopoeia: Naming something based on the sound associated with it, such as, “The horses clopped along the cobblestone street.” We recognize that horse hooves make the sound of “clop, clop, clop” when walking on such surfaces. 

- Oxymoron: A label, phrase, or statement made of seemingly contradictory or incongruous words, such as, “differentiated standardization” or “standardized differentiation.”

- Parable: An extended metaphor told as a small story, usually to illustrate a moral.

- Paradox: A statement or situation in which elements seem to contradict common sense or what is currently accepted as truth. An example would be the Grandfather Paradox in time travel theories; we find it impossible to go back through a time machine to kill our grandfather before he married our grandmother and gave birth to our mother who in turn gave birth to us. If we were never born, how do we account for the role we played in the death of our grandparent? A paradox becomes metaphorical when we compare one paradox with another: “Creating a physically invisible plane is like pushing a camel through the eye of a needle.”

- Personification: Giving human qualities to inanimate objects. “The clock ticked loudly, each second-hand sweep scolding me like a schoolmaster and reminding me that I would never finish the exam in the allotted time.”

- Predicative metaphor: The use of specific verbs to connote something other than literally what they state, such as, “John faced reality,” “When she became the chief executive officer, she shattered the glass ceiling,” or “His hopes were crushed when he opened the socks for a birthday present.”

- Rhetorical question: An inquiry asked just to get listeners to think further about a topic but without the expectation of a definite response: “Let’s consider the possibility—could this disease become the next Ebola virus?”

- Simile: A comparison between two unlike objects or ideas using like or as in the comparison: “His speech was like frost: we shivered slightly and
tried to preserve the ebbing warmth.”

- Symbol: An object, sign, character, act, or a small graphic that represents something else. For example, + represents addition. While an abstract symbol can represent a real object, such as the figure of a woman on the women’s washroom door, a symbol can also represent something abstract, such as the symbol , which represents peace. An act can also be a symbol for an abstract idea. For instance, a large gathering of voters for a political candidate is a symbol of animosity toward the current leader.

- Synecdoche: A type of metonymy in which a specific part of something is used to refer to that larger something, such as “Many hands cleaned the park on Saturday,” where hands are an actual part of the people who cleaned the park. Metonymy can also include those phrases where the smaller item of reference is only associated with the larger category, but is not literally a part of it. In the example “The White House blocked the tax reforms,” the White House refers to the president and his advisers, but it is not literally a part of any of the bodies of those people. 

- Synectics: “The joining together of different and apparently irrelevant elements,” or put more simply, “making the familiar strange”. Students use synectics when they describe a topic in terms of a completely unrelated category, such as listing four connections between parts of speech and a coral reef or between the settlement of a continent and the patterns of insect behavior. In health class, the student might compare a part of the human body with a sport: “The endocrine system is like playing zones in basketball because each player or gland is responsible for his or her area of the game (body).”
