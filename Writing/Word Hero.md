## The Pith Method. 
Write down what you want to say, then find the two or three key words that sum up your points. 

Boil down, and boil down some more, until you have two or three key words. Then use those words in a sentence. You’re talking sports, say, and two players famous for their sportsmanship on and off the field get into a brief fight. You want to say something memorable to your friends, or at least get a laugh. Time for “true confessions”: What is this topic really about, at least from the storytelling standpoint? Think of some key words.

FIGHT, ATHLETES, POLITENESS
 
What are the words that grab you? “Fight” certainly does. Athletes? Yeah, it’s about athletes. Nothing unusual there. “Politeness” doesn’t scintillate either, usually; but “politeness” and “fight” make a surprising combination. So let’s delete “athletes” and try to use the other two words, or some form of them, in a sentence.

YOU: It was the politest fight of the weekend.

OK, it won’t get a laugh, but it’s a start. Sports Illustrated writer Brant James took the idea of polite fighting a step further in a National Public Radio interview about two gentlemanly NASCAR drivers who got into a tussle after a race. (“Sort of an aggressive hug” is how James described it.) He took the concept of “the politest fight of the weekend” and turned it into an analogy.

JAMES: This was Switzerland and Sweden goin’ at it.

The notion of two of the politest, most neutral countries in the world getting into a tussle: in a certain crowd, that would get a laugh. What’s impressive is that James seemed to have come up with the line spontaneously. As a professional sportswriter, he has had plenty of practice applying analogies to sports events. What about the rest of us? How can we come up with great stuff like that? Well, practice helps.

EXERCISE

One of the most fun exercises is to write a six-word review of your favorite movie. Use the pith method to help you boil down the plot, characters, and setting.
- Ocean’s Eleven: Clooney robs Vegas. Ten guys help.
- Toy Story: Outgrown toys speak witty product lines.
- Avatar: An out-of-body planet rescue.

Six-word exercises have grown popular since Smith College’s alumni magazine began a contest for best six-word memoirs. Their slogan: “One life. Six words. What’s yours?” The magazine runs the challenge to honor Ernest Hemingway, who mastered the extremely short story genre years ago with, “For sale: baby shoes. Never worn.” You may surprise yourself with your own wit and possible profundity. To sum it up in six words: half of witcraft is boiling down.

## Unwriting.
Take a quotation you love, and rewrite it in the plainest possible language. Then compare this simple version with the original. What’s the key difference that makes the quote work so well? If you look carefully, you should see the SPA within most Take a quotation you love, and rewrite it in the plainest possible language. Then compare this simple version with the original. What’s the key difference that makes the quote work so well? If you look carefully, you should see the SPA within most memorable expressions: a sound, a picture, or an association. While sounds and pictures are relatively easy, associations take some practice. Often you’ll find a trope—nonliteral language that associates the subject with an alternative reality.

Mad Lib Protocol.

Take the key words in a favorite quote and “blank” them out with the relevant parts of speech: (noun) for The New Yorker, (verb) for edited. Now see if you can fill in blanks with relevant words of your own. Not all quotes lend themselves to this exercise. For instance, how could you possibly Mad Lib this great W. C. Fields line?

FIELDS: Water? Never touch the stuff. Fish fornicate in it.

Still, you’d have fun trying. “Tequila? Never touch the stuff. Worms fornicate in it.”

## Sound Effects
Sound Symbolism. The position of your mouth makes things seem big or small, significant or unimportant.

Onomatopoeia. A sound effect that grew up and became a word.

Sound Repeaters. Uses the same sound at the beginning, middle, or end of consecutive words.

## Play with words
Puns can make for good labels. For instance, Democrats should point out the hidden costs we pay when Republicans propose tax cuts. Cut back road maintenance, and car maintenance costs go up. Slash park budgets, and you get slapped with user fees. And so on. Democrats should call these charges “sneak-a-tax.” Your state legislature plans to cut aid to education? Parents will suddenly bear an added burden for textbooks; and without adequate music programs, private lessons will have to replace high school marching band and orchestra. Sneak-a-tax! It’s like a tax … but sneaky!

So how do you make one of those things? By familiarizing yourself with homonyms, words that sound the same but have different meanings. Homonym means “same name” in ancient Greek. It serves as the raw material of puns; a homonym is to puns what gunpowder is to fireworks. “A tax” and “attacks” are homonyms (well, close enough for government work). So, to create “sneak attacks” out of the hidden costs of tax cuts, you follow the four-step homonymnastics approach.

1. Say what you mean. Find the pith and the key words: this so-called tax cut is really just a sneaky way to disguise more taxes.

2. List possible homonyms. What sounds like “tax”? Tacks, ax, acts, pax … attacks!

3. Put the homonyms in phrases, whether they make sense or not in this context. Thumb tax (on the seat of power!), ax cuts … tax attacks.

4. Try your homonyms in context. What’s sneaky about a thumb tax, or a tax attack? A sneak tax attack … a sneak-a-tax!

## Catalog
Scientists say that an average thought lasts no more than a minute before we lose it. What’s more, most of us find it impossible to learn more than one new concept every ten minutes. But research also shows that people more easily absorb thoughts that have been divided into chunks. Clever chunking can prolong an attention span, turning an explanation or story into a mental movie.

One of the easiest ways to chunk a setting, situation, or idea is to convert it into a catalog—a list that describes characteristics or contents. A catalog breaks something down into its constituent parts, letting the mental camera run slowly over them. You see the forest better for the trees, by showing how the trees make up the forest. The genius of this figure lies not only in its simplicity but in the way it allows the coiner to organize the contents. 

Observe this superb example by Margaret Wise Brown. It comes from one of my favorite poems; not really a poem, actually, but the unforgettable children’s book Goodnight Moon. In just two sentences, Brown gives a clear impression of a rich little kid (a rabbit in the pictures) who employs stalling tactics to keep from having to go to sleep.

BROWN: In the great, green room there was a telephone, and a red balloon, and a picture of a cow jumping over the moon. And there were three little bears sitting on chairs, and two little kittens, and a pair of mittens, and a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady who was whispering hush.

UNWRITTEN: “Hush, now,” said the Quiet Old Lady as the Rabbit Child said good night to everything in the room. And such a room it was, too!

To create your own catalog, follow two easy steps—and I do mean easy:

1. List the telling details. If you need to, use the pith method to find the key words. Don’t feel obligated to leave in all the minutiae—just the elements that get you where you want to go with your audience. Are you trying to make your audience comfortable and sleepy? Then leave out the stiletto heel kicked off by the drunken mother in the great, green room.

2. Organize your list. When you describe a scene, think about a movie camera’s panning shot. When a beautiful woman gets out of a cab, we first see her legs, followed by the rest of her, before the camera pulls back to reveal the rest of the scene. Similarly, when you describe a person in a catalog, you can begin from the ground up, or the top down. Or you can start with the person’s most eye-grabbing characteristic, and let the mental camera pan up or down from there before pulling back.

Besides the camera technique, you can arrange your list in a variety of ways.

Chronologically. If you tell a story with a list, chronological order usually works best. This happened, and then this. One way to do a chronology by catalog is to leave out the “ands” or “buts” the way a play-by-play announcer works. You can see how legendary sports announcer Vin Scully used it to build tension.

SCULLY: Sandy backs off, mops his forehead, runs his left index finger along his forehead, dries it off on his left pants leg.

YOU: I packed all the bags, fed the kids, loaded the car, shepherded the kids onboard, stopped for gas … and then discovered I’d left my eldest behind.

In order of importance. Speaking of building to something: on the fifth anniversary of the Katrina disaster, President Obama told his audience that he wouldn’t “dwell on what you experienced and what the world witnessed,” and then he proceeded to dwell on the experience.

OBAMA: We all remember it keenly: water pouring through broken levees; mothers holding their children above the waterline; people stranded on rooftops begging for help; bodies lying in the streets of a great American city.

While there’s some chronology to this list, Obama mainly ordered it for dramatic effect, proceeding from the alarming to the tragic. A broken levee was news; bodies in the streets challenged our identity as a nation. If you want to organize your catalog by importance, start from the least and work to the most. Use this form in political speech to sum up an issue. It also works when you’re accusing a loved one of a chain of sins. Begin with showing up late for the party and work your way up to the point where he does embarrassing things with a lampshade.

From the general to the particular. Obama’s striking scene might have been even more striking if he had ended his list not with “bodies” but with a single body—maybe someone who had been identified, someone with a name. The technique works on more trivial subjects as well. Think of the movie camera again, starting with the panoramic shot and zeroing in on the main character. Ronald Reagan would often end a list of facts with an anecdote that humanized them. “An example is better than a sermon,” he liked to say. He went from the general to the particular, talking about government policy then showing how government policy ruined a small farmer in Chicot County, Arkansas; or talking about defense and then pointing to a heroic soldier in the balcony. You can do the same when your list consists of facts, including those in a business presentation. Put the finest detail last in a bullet list, going from general trends to the effect on a particular store or branch office.

With rhyme. Margaret Wise Brown didn’t just use her catalog of the great, green room’s contents geographically; the list also works poetically, using a set of rhymes (kittens-mittens, brush-mush-hush) to create the softest rap song ever written. Rhyming works especially well in an invitation. Compare these two versions.

UNWRITTEN: I’m throwing a party.

CATALOGED: I’m throwing a beer-and-Skittles, rhyme-and-riddles party.

### Mr. Potato Head
Another kind of cataloging figure breaks down a person or object into constituent parts and then pretends that those parts came from elsewhere. I call it Mr. Potato Head. The journalist William Allen White used this device beautifully in his obituary of publisher Frank Munsey.

WHITE: … the talent of a meat packer, the morals of a money changer and the manners of an undertaker.
 
With just three phrases, White gives you a vivid image of the oily crook. You can use it as a form of self-deprecating humor.

YOU: When I play tennis, I have the agility of a tank, the aim of a mole, and the response time of FEMA.

The Mr. Potato Head figure comes in handy when you want to call attention to a variety of characteristics by exaggerating them. Say you want to describe a party you went to last Saturday: a chaotic, drunken mess with appalling music, badly dressed guests, and the kind of mayo-drenched snacks that give people food poisoning. Instead of droning on and on about how awful it was, try chunking up a nice Potato Head.

YOU: A lovely party! The food of a bachelor’s fridge, the music playlist of an aging hair-band roadie, and guests straight out of Dumb and Dumber, without the witty dialogue.

Creating your own Mr. Potato Head isn’t hard. Just take a characteristic or part of the subject you want to describe, and come up with an analog for it. Then take the next characteristic or part, find an analog, and continue until your subject is thoroughly spudded. An analog is something that’s analogous—an analogy.

YOU: The book had the prose style of the Congressional Record, the characterization of a computer manual, and the suspense of a phone book.

An even more fun way to use this figure is to throw in a surprise by offering an unflattering analog at the end of a list of nice ones.

ME: He had the body of Adonis, the eyes of a hypnotist, and the brains of an aging invertebrate.

EXERCISES
 
1. Describe a person in plain language. Now put that description into a Mr. Potato Head.

POTATO HEAD: She has the clothing sense of a cheerleader, the makeup skills of a circus clown, and the hair of a Barbie.

2. Count your blessings. Besides being a proven mood lifter, this exercise lets you practice balancing the expected with the unexpected in a catalog. For every “normal” blessing, give thanks for a blessing that some people would consider a curse. If you really want to get fancy, link these odd pairs with alliteration or rhyming.

YOU: Thank God for my wonderful family and worthy foes, for working play and playful work, for candy and carrots, sunny days and shady ways.

### THE RUSSIAN DOLL’S FIGURE
 
Another way to catalog is to wrap your items up. Winston Churchill, that world-class master of figuring, did this at the beginning of the Second World War, referring to Russia.

CHURCHILL: It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

Notice how Churchill uses the Russian nesting doll as a metaphor to illustrate the whole nation. But it works even when you’re not playing metaphorically with dolls.

EMILY YOFFE (in Slate.com): Many countries collectively agree … that children are a tantrum wrapped in a diaper and not worth the trouble.

To deploy the figure, it helps to have an object with some sort of covering. A diaper serves as a natural covering for babies. But your wrapping doesn’t have to be cloth. You might have your victim cover himself.

YOU: The principal is a rulebook wrapped in pomposity inside a whole lot of bad skin.

Suppose you wanted to say something memorable about the fire hazard of a Christmas tree. You can convert it into a comparable object, cover it with something, wrap it with something else, and deliver a good scare.

YOU: A Christmas tree is an incendiary bomb covered in needles and wrapped in electric bulbs.

UNWRITTEN: A Christmas tree is a terrible fire hazard.

Excercise

Remember that poor friend you described in a Mr. Potato Head? Put that same description into a Russian doll. You may find that the Potato Head can serve as the raw material for your doll.

POTATO HEAD: She has the clothing sense of a cheerleader, the makeup skills of a circus clown, and the hair of a Barbie.

RUSSIAN DOLL: She’s a circus clown wrapped in pom-poms and topped with a hair extension.

### Multiple Synonyms
A catalog doesn’t simply have to describe a variety of traits and objects. You can catalog a single trait or object by rendering its synonyms. It’s an excellent way to exaggerate a particular characteristic. Remember the Monty Python dead parrot sketch?

JOHN CLEESE: It’s not pinin’! It’s passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It’s expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot. It’s a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn’t nailed it to the perch it’d be pushing up the daisies! It’s run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!

In this same vein of exaggeration, piling on synonyms also helps convey multitudinousness.

YOU: He was big, huge, linebacker huge, refrigerator huge, large. He contained multitudes.

To make your own multiple synonyms, boil down your point to just one key word, then return to your favorite thesaurus. I just keyed “dead” into thesaurus.com, and found some additions to John Cleese’s parrot eulogy.

ME: This parrot has bought the farm. He has checked out. He’s defunct, departed, gone to meet his maker. He is a bygone parrot whose date has expired. He is exsanguinous, spectral, and eternally imperturbable.

JOSEPH CONRAD: She strode like a grenadier, was strong and upright like an obelisk, had a beautiful face, a candid brow, pure eyes, and not a thought of her own in her head.

Multiple synonyms can do the same for you, and not necessarily to deliver an insult. You might want to describe a terrible movie thusly.

YOU: It had color, noise, huge clashing armies, sound and fury, and not a single believable character.

 
Or you can deliver the opposite emotion by praising a hard adventure.

YOU: The hike was painful, agonizing, arduous, and the most fun thing I’ve ever done.

## Descriptive Label
We created a picture by assembling the parts, like a jigsaw puzzle. A trickier tool, the descriptive label, pins a snapshot on a person, thing, or concept. But wait, that’s not the tricky part; the snapshot then becomes the thing it depicts, representing the original in people’s minds.

RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY: She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed.
HOGWARTS RESIDENTS: He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

What’s the difference between a descriptive label and a nickname? One can easily turn into the other. A descriptive label, though, can stand on its own, serving as a description of someone you’ve never met.

FRIEND: So do you know who drove an ATV through your land?

YOU: I saw him but don’t know his name. Fat guy. Orca with legs. At least I think he had legs. He wasn’t using them at the time.
 
What will get quoted among those words? I’m guessing “orca with legs.” A good descriptive label attaches an indelible label to someone, becoming not just a substitute for a name but a whole new name in its own right—not as concise as Whatshisname but more memorable. The humorist Tom Bodette told how some Indian tribes have a tradition of naming newborns after a notable event that took place before the birth. He said if he and his wife had followed that custom their kid would have been named Datsun-That-Won’t-Start. I rather like that tradition. It attaches a story to every kid, preferably one with a moral; young Datsun presumably would grow up taking the Check Engine light very seriously.

EXERCISE
 
We victimized a friend with a Mr. Potato Head and a Russian doll. Can you take the same description and turn it into a descriptive label?

YOU: The Hair Extension.

A descriptive label need not restrict itself to people, though. A school could become the Brick House or the Smells Lab. A stereotype map of the A descriptive label need not restrict itself to people, though. A school could become the Brick House or the Smells Lab. A stereotype map of the world posted on i.imgur.com recently applied descriptive labels to every region of the globe. Canada gets the label “Drunks and Nothing.” The northeast coast of the United States is “Freaks”; West Coast is “Stoners.” In between is “Jesus and Meth.” India is “Tech Support,” New Zealand is “Hobbits,” and everything south of that is “Stupid Penguins.” While some people might find it offensive, I think the map says more about attitudes than the regions themselves.

### Slogan
A close cousin to the descriptive label makes it easier to say nice things about people. The slogan is like a descriptive label, except that it isn’t meant to substitute for the name. Instead, the figure enhances the name.

Slogans can make a big difference in someone’s posthumous reputation as well. Take Peter the Great, and how much more fondly history remembers the drunken, murdering Russian westernizer than, say, Britain’s Edward Lackland (they also called him Edward Softsword) or Ethelred the Unready.

Yes, a slogan can hurt as well as flatter. The late, lamented Spy magazine—a triumph of journalistic snark in the late eighties and early nineties—could hardly mention a celebrity without sticking a deprecatory slogan onto him. Socialite Nan Kempner was “Nan Kempner, the knock-kneed socialite”; Henry Kissinger was Kissinger, “the chubby socialite-war criminal”; Sylvester Stallone was “unbearable Play–Doh–faced homunculus–action toy Sylvester Stallone.” You can accomplish the same labeling feat by attaching a description to the end—or, sometimes, the beginning—of a person’s name.

Bob the incompetent plumber

Plump, frizzy-haired Sharon

Dave the Great Guy

### Definition
A label comprises a kind of definition. If Dave had an entry in the dictionary, it would read: Dave (n) Nice guy. When you describe a concept rather than a person, you can label the whole thing with a simple definition. Jon Stewart often does this on the Daily Show.

STEWART: The Internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom.

The writer Ambrose Bierce out-Stewarted Stewart more than a century before. In A Devil’s Dictionary, Bierce defined terms in a way that spelled out a whole dark attitude.
Befriend: To make an ingrate

Destiny: A tyrant’s authority for crime and a fool’s excuse for failure

Discussion: A method of confirming others in their errors

Robber: A candid man of affairs

Saint: A dead sinner revised and edited

Truth: An ingenious compound of desirability and appearance

A definition is a kind of alchemy in which a description and a rule are blended together in an attempt to create the truth. When the definer succeeds, the result is memorable. You set your opinion in stone. So if I want to oppose off-road vehicles on my town’s roads, I should start with the sentence “Off-road vehicles are …” and fill in the blank.

ME: Off-road vehicles are lawsuits on wheels.
 
Not bad. But I don’t want to focus too much on lawsuits.

ME: Off-road vehicles are a form of rolling vandalism.

Nah. Too fancy. Remember, my town cares mostly about the cost issue.

ME: Off-road vehicles are toys that burn our money as well as gas.

To create your own definition, go through the pith method to get the key words. Now you’ll have to narrow those words down to a single word; more than one definition starts looking more like a dictionary than a memorable expression. Then apply a rule to the word. What do ORVs end up in? Vandalism and lawsuits. Then attach wheels to them, reminding your audience of what you’re defining. ORVs are very expensive toys, except that most toys don’t burn money. Or trigger landowner liability lawsuits, for that matter.

A definition is really a form of description, reinforced with a dictionary-like authority. Or, as Ambrose Bierce might put it:

Definition: Words that turn opinion into truth

## TRANSFORM THINGS
### ABSOLUTE SCENARIO: USING WHIPPETS AND NAKED ASSISTANTS
But let’s start with the most extreme kind of hyperbole, which I call the last-person-on-earth figure. Young ladies have traditionally used it to destroy the self-esteem of lads throughout the ages.

YOUNG LADY: I wouldn’t go out with you even if there was a second worldwide flood and Noah himself invited us on board to propagate the species.

UNWRITTEN: I don’t want to go out with you under any circumstances.

You can use the last-person-on-earth technique as a ready-made figure, Mad Libs style.

YOU: I wouldn’t (verb), even if (scenario).

While a logician will question whether you can exaggerate an impossibility, most people will tell you (illogically) that anything is possible. So, yes, in the real world, you can exaggerate that case. Instead of merely saying “No way,” recruit the last person on earth for dramatic or comical effect. Watch what Slate columnist Jack Schafer does in admiring a colleague’s reporting.

SCHAFER: Hell, I couldn’t write a better piece if given a month, five naked research assistants, and a crate of whippets.

You can see a positive version of the last person on earth here. Use this method to praise someone.

YOU: Nice voice! I couldn’t sing that better with another five beers and a goose from Suzie.

Of course, people might take this wrong. They might think you’re being sarcastic, which maybe you are. If you are being sarcastic, then make sure you take it over the top.

YOU: Lovely singing voice! I couldn’t sing better while gargling ice cubes with my finger in the socket.

Lavishly compliment a loved one using the last-person-on-earth figure. Use three items for comparison, starting with a fairly reasonable one and working your way up to the truly outrageous.

YOU: Wow, you couldn’t look better if you’d taken a Pilates class, gotten your hair done like that secretary on Mad Men, and wore a dress with a Frederick’s of Hollywood label.

Your loved one may doubt your sincerity; in which case, let her compliment you back for laughs. Can the figure work seriously as well? Of course it can—the last-person makes a memorable addition to a retirement luncheon. (“I doubt that anyone could do better with …”) And it can make a half-serious reply to a teenager’s unreasonable request for the car. (“I don’t care if every girl on earth is clamoring for your attention and you’re late for an audition with American Idol. You’re not getting the car.”) But for practice, try using the last-person figure humorously. I find it easier than the more straight-faced version.

### REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM: WAR IN HIGH HEELS
When security consultant George Friedman wanted to ridicule the notion that America could be made safe from terrorist threat, he used a tried-and-true rhetorical technique, the reductio ad absurdum, or “reduction to absurdity.” Speaking to a USA Today reporter, he used the technique to exaggerate the notion of a secure nation.

FRIEDMAN: You don’t have the resources to childproof the entire country.

You don’t get safer than childproofing. While the reductio ad absurdum reduces the logic, it blows up the conclusion, pursuing the argument to an illogical end. Absurdum has a very specific purpose: to exaggerate the weakness in someone else’s argument.

To produce one, first look for the weak spot. Suppose you attend a school board meeting in which someone suggests making the sports teams sell raw carrots instead of homemade cookies to raise funds. The proponent points to the epidemic of childhood obesity, and rightly notes that carrots are better for kids than cookies. So what’s the weakness in that argument, other than the likelihood of young athletes rioting in the parking lot? Well, in order for the carrots to raise money, people have to buy them; and cookies are way easier to sell than carrots.

Having spotted the weakness, you proceed to exploit it. Dream up a scenario in which students are pelted with carrots by homeowners who resent kids lecturing them about their diet. Or the town having to deal with an infestation of rabbits after piles of carrots are dumped all over town. Or the team selling so few they’ll have to improvise.

YOU: They’ll be stuffing carrots into the buses’ gas tanks as an alternative fuel source.

The absurdum can also work in the form of an if-then clause: if your opponent’s absurd point is true, then this even more absurd point must also be true. Scriptwriters use this method whenever they depict a celebrity meeting regular folk.

KATY PERRY: Hi, I’m Katy Perry.

REGULAR GUY: Yeah, and I’m Ben Stiller.

The if-then clause can help you take apart any ridiculous assertion, such as corporate execs declaring themselves heart surgeons. While Saletan’s sentence has a certain elegance to it, I like my rhetorical heart surgery delivered in a less sterile fashion.

ME: If this is heart surgery, I’d rather have it done by an auto mechanic.

Richard Haass, a former State Department official under George W. Bush, used an if-then clause in response to President Bush calling the war in Afghanistan “an opportunity.”

HAASS: If this is an opportunity, what’s Iraq? A once-in-a-lifetime chance?

Creating your own if-then clause simply entails provisionally accepting the other person’s point by repeating it with an “If” in front (“If this is an opportunity …”). This buys you time to think of two things:

1. A comparable—something associated with the subject of your opponent’s sentence. (If a, then b.)
2. A possible exaggeration of that comparable. (If a does b, then x does y.)

### PRECISION: COLD, HARD, INFLATED NUMBERS
When you speak to your own kind about a rival or enemy, you can use exaggeration as a way of bringing the tribe together. Aristotle called this kind of language “demonstrative”; it deals with absolutes, particularly the values you share. Hyperbole fits right into this kind of speech. When the audience expands to include some who are outside the tribe, though, the results can be laughable. Republicans looked pretty silly, for example, when their attacks on the Federal Reserve got repeated beyond Fox News and right-wing websites. In order to inject some financial Viagra into the flaccid American economy, the Fed bought up some government bonds in a policy it called “quantitative easing.” While this isn’t the stuff of a Matt Damon thriller—don’t ask me how the government can buy its own debt—the Republicans saw it as an opportunity to stir up their own base. One commentator called this bond purchase “injecting high-grade monetary heroin” into the economy. Another warned of an “undead homicidal zombie market.” Cool! You can picture tailored Federal Reserve bankers shot-gunning stoned, bloody-mawed zombie quantitative easlings as they stagger down Wall Street. Maybe this is the stuff of a Matt Damon thriller after all.

One of the most effective ways to pull off an exaggeration is to make it sound precise and objective—no zombies, just cold, hard, inflated numbers. The truer, more accurate you can make a hyperbole sound, the better it comes off. Compare these two lines about the weather in New England.

MARK TWAIN: In the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four-and-twenty hours.

UNWRITTEN: In a single day the weather changes a billion times.

Twain’s version sounds positively scientific. The unwritten version just sounds like a throwaway exaggeration. The lesson? When you exaggerate, try to make it sound like an understatement.

SPOUSE: Did I ever tell you about how my great-grandfather patented a false nose for circus clowns?

YOU: Precisely eighty-two times. Not counting this one.
 
Exact-sounding numbers lend verisimilitude to exaggeration, and reality is funnier than fiction, even if the “reality” is fictional. 

### UNDERSTATEMENT: NOT QUITE SHOT OR DROWNED
One problem with exaggeration, which feigned precision tries to alleviate, is an audience’s tendency to discount your claim—especially if, like me, you favor hyperbole overmuch. But you can actually cause an image to expand in your audience’s head if you deliver it as an understatement. In the right circumstances, downplaying your words can make you sound heroic. In other words, understatement can give people an exaggerated picture of you. Watch Winston Churchill at understated work.

CHURCHILL: Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.

UNWRITTEN: I’ve been shot at in battle, and the sense of exhilaration of emerging unscathed is indescribable.

Admittedly, you may have to be British and the possessor of an extra-stiff upper lip to get away with the line he used. “Without result” is marvelous because it conveys “Nothing happened” in the lowest of low-key terms while making the audience think of what “result” means. They think, “He could have been killed.” War lends itself to understatement, because the horrors speak for themselves. The legendary Admiral William Halsey sent a radio message in October 1944, after the Japanese claimed that the American Third Fleet had been sunk or had “retired.”

HALSEY: Our ships have been salvaged and are retiring at high speed toward the Japanese fleet.

UNWRITTEN: Propaganda to the contrary, our ships are in working order. In fact, we’re attacking the Japanese.

We live in such a bombastic time that you might wonder whether a heroic understatement like Halsey’s might even get noticed. The TV talk mavens get paid for hysteria, not wit. But I like to think that scarcity breeds value. (So does excess, apparently; it depends on the audience.) A rule of thumb in talking about an injury is to downplay the injury in a way that calls attention to it. Instead of acting like my kids and claiming a split-open head, let your audience acquire the gore on their own.

YOU: My collarbone? Tree attack.

ADMIRER: You hit a tree?

YOU: No, the tree attacked my bike. I was just in the way.

Litotes

Another form of understatement, the litotes (lie-TOE-tees), exaggerates the opposite while denying it. I’m using the technical name here because you’ll find it in increasingly common usage in college and even high school classes. Besides, it’s only three syllables, and just two if you mispronounce it and call it a LIE-toats.

Watch how the figure works in these examples.

He didn’t exactly set the art world on fire.

Let’s say the play wasn’t a smash hit.

I’m not defusing bombs for my health, here.

In other words, the art and the play bombed, and working with bombs is extremely unhealthy. Which makes the litotes a kind of understatement, right? Yes, albeit an over-the-top understatement. Then again, not exactly over the top. Maybe a little under the top.

The greatest litotes in history was an often-misquoted cable sent by Mark Twain after newspapers erroneously reported his death.

TWAIN: The report of my death was an exaggeration.
 
The quote counts as a litotes because it denies a hyperbole. Twain also reveals an important quality of the device: it lets you call attention to a hyperbole in a hyperbolic way. By using a litotes to deny his death, he implies that he’s not exactly in the full flower of youth.

Americans as a culture are not very good at being wry. We like too much noise and optimism for wryness. Which is why we should practice it. The figure surprises people who are used to hearing straight hyperbole. The litotes is doubly surprising because it expresses an understatement through hyperbole. It works especially well when someone states the obvious. Respond by denying the hyperbolic opposite—the more ridiculous, the better.

LOVED ONE: Looks like rain.

YOU: Yes, it’s not exactly a day when the sun does its smiley face in the sky and bluebirds dance on your shoulder.

LOVED ONE: What’s gotten into you?

## Change Reality
Metaphor. A trope that claims a is b.

Simile. A comparison, a is like b. Lookalike

Like … Only Technique. A simile, with exceptions.

Analogy. A kind of extended simile: a acts like b.

### Belonging Trope. 
Takes an aspect of something and makes it represent the whole. The synecdoche uses a part or member, while the metonymy uses a characteristic, container, or purpose.

## Tension
1. Between paired unalike things.

2. Between what you deliver and what your audience expects.

Tension lies behind great storytelling, humor, sex, and persuasion.

### PARADOXOLOGY
 
When you want to describe any person memorably, toss in bad and good ingredients of their personality and let them have at it. This is especially true of someone you dislike. Watch the difference between a 100 percent evil description and one that’s a little more ambiguous.

EVIL: She had a thin, quick, mean look about her—scary-looking even when she smiled, which was rare.

AMBIGUOUS: She was lithe and smart and quick as a whippet, with the rare smile that a whippet makes just before it bites.

The evil version is conversational, descriptive, and blandly unmemorable. The second version condemns the victim to an infamous eternity by starting out pleasantly—creating tension.

Frederic William Henry Myers used paradox to describe Saint Paul.

MYERS: Coldly sublime, intolerably just.

The line makes me shiver. Whether you think Myers is playing fair or not, the technique is flawless: bad paired with good in each balanced phrase. You don’t have to be nearly as literary to be memorable. Just think of a way to balance the good and bad side of every trait.

A paradox takes a pair of truths and mashes them together like positive and negative ions in a nuclear experiment. The opposites can be attractive, helping your audience understand complexity while holding their attention.

Contradictions come up a lot when we describe people. Just look at reasonable key words for famous people. The terms frequently contradict all on their own.

Lindsay Lohan: Beautiful, funny, screw-loose drunken nutcase

Sarah Palin: Fit, savvy, tough, funny, vicious

George Clooney: Handsome, suave, monotonal 

Mel Gibson: Handsome, funny, racist drunken nutcase

 
You don’t have to describe a person to find a good paradox.

JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Christians chop down trees to make houses to put trees in.

Most Christians don’t chop down trees, and the primary purpose of houses isn’t to hold Christmas trees, but Foer found a funny, paradoxical way to accuse Christians of environmental hypocrisy. Here’s the same way to do what Foer did.

ME: Developers destroy fox habitat to build developments called “Fox Fields.”

The tension here should be obvious. People often mistakenly call this sort of activity “ironic,” but it’s really a paradox—a set of conflicting notions. The development’s sign, on the other hand, is unintentionally ironic. It says one thing (a field for foxes) while standing for something else (doomed foxes).

To create a paradox of your own, look for a contradiction in a person, subject, or issue. It can come from hypocrisy, as Jonathan Safran Foer’s Christmas trees did. Take so-called social conservatives’ stand on gay marriage. An advocate for gay marriage might point out that the high divorce rate threatens the institution of marriage more than licensing stable gay relationships would. Part of that argument could be expressed in a paradox.

YOU: They’re protecting marriage by opposing it.

The world is full of flippable stereotypes. Suppose you want to describe someone as fat and lazy. Can you think of a busy animal that’s plump, along with a lazy creature not known for its obesity? Beavers are industrious and well rounded. Snakes are skinny and not known to be particularly hardworking, but they carry too much symbolic baggage for us to think of them as simply slim and lazy. Sloths aren’t slim, but they might do the job lazily.

YOU: Fat and lazy? She has the shape of a beaver and the work ethic of a sloth.

### Oxymoron
The ancient Greeks, those witty chaps, made their term for an oxymoron … an oxymoron! The word means “sharp dullness”—referring to “cleverly stupid,” not “old knife that can give you tetanus.”

That etymology helps us understand why bipartisanship fails in Congress these days. In a democracy, “partisanship” means “along party lines.” As in, “I’m voting for this even though it doesn’t make any sense, simply because I’m a (circle one) Democrat/Republican.” “Bi,” when not used by adolescent males, means “two.” Put them together and the meaning becomes, “People who detest each other singing ‘Kumbaya’ for the cameras.” When people go beyond party lines and actually accomplish something—I’m old enough to remember when that actually happened in Washington—the effort is not bipartisan but nonpartisan. The oxymoron makes for a nice parlor game, the winner being the person who comes up with the most apt one.

Airline food

Military intelligence (Groucho Marx first pointed out this one, of course)

Open secret

Microsoft Works

Free love

Jumbo shrimp

Pretty ugly

Undeclared voter

Continental breakfast (hardly continent sized)

Compassionate conservative

You may see some stereotype flipping here: Microsoft is infamous for its klugey software. To consider “free love” an oxymoron, you have to think of love in typically cynical terms. The oxymoron often flips stereotypes. You can, too, by listening for terms that contradict commonly accepted notions of a subject.


Another way to pick up an oxymoron is to think homonymnastically: look for puns that make ordinary expressions seem paradoxical. Try to ignore the sexism of this next example. I’m just making a point.

ME: She was a skinny broad, and that wasn’t the only part of her that was oxymoronic.
 
“Broad” simply denotes “woman.” The sexism lies in the belonging trope, which stares at the broad part of her otherwise skinny flesh. “Jumbo shrimp” does the same thing, as does “pretty ugly.” By thinking of puns, and constantly pithing in your head, you can come up with oxymorons to label ideas or movements you oppose. Imagine that you dislike the Democrats’ health-care plan because you believe that it spends a lot of money to buy very little. Write down your key words or list them in your head: liberal, health, helping, expensive …

Being a pun-oriented type myself, I see “liberal helping” as a pun.

ME: Only the Democrats could make “liberal helping” an oxymoron.

### CONTRASTS: USING MERLOT AND SEX
While paradoxes shackle opposites to create tension, you can achieve the same tightening effect with figures that show the differences between things. Figures of contrast let you leverage the world, using one thing to make another thing seem larger or smaller, less or more important.

It’s mind control, man. Look what happens in the classic 1950 film Sunset Boulevard.

JOE: You’re Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.

NORMA: I am big. It’s the pictures that got small.

 
In just two lines you get the theme of the movie: has-been film prima donna lamenting a Golden Age of moving pictures. We need to spend a little time on this gem of a quote, because it illustrates a powerful tool for memorability—one that sets up a contrast in order to change the perspective on an object. Picture short-statured Tom Cruise. Put him next to even shorter-statured Drew Barrymore, and he looks tall. Cast him with six-foot-tall Uma Thurman and he’ll insist on some computer magic to shrink the woman. Poor old Norma Desmond works the same magic figuratively. Rude young Joe says she used to be big, which implies that she (or her reputation) has shrunk. Norma rebuts that assertion by setting up a contrast. By pulling in the movies that had been made since her prime, and shrinking them, she refocuses her own reputation. Result: one of the best-remembered lines in movie history.

A logician might point out that her line makes no rational sense. If pictures have gotten smaller, wouldn’t that have made Norma look bigger? Or is she saying that the diminished state of film shrank everyone associated with it? Ah, here you find the true beauty—and manipulative evil—of figures and tropes, which appeal to right-brain, intuitive, emotional responses. They have to do with magic; and even a Muggle knows that magic gets a bye from the rules of logic. Or, to put it metaphorically, figures and tropes are perpetual motion machines. They chug away on their own volition into eternity as people repeat them through the generations. Every logician or physicist will tell you that perpetual motion machines are impossible. They’re magic. Therefore, this trope is magic. Let’s make some.

Start with the exact same expand-by-shrinking-something-else technique that Norma used. Only we’ll do it in reverse. Suppose someone insulted your shape.

ERK: Sure you ought to eat that? Your spare tire has gone from economy to full size.

YOU: My stomach isn’t bigger. It’s the shirt that got smaller.

Nah, too easy. Besides, the American clothing industry has you covered, literally. My own size has gone from large to medium on most clothing, and I certainly haven’t shrunk. We need to be more clever, and in the process see just how this particular figure can help you and your figure. We should “privilege” the object under question, as a modern rhetorician would say. Bring in comparables to place next to your object and make it look better in contrast. Now think of things that would privilege your underappreciated, overestimated stomach.

Contraster
 
Remember, logic need not be an element here. We want to show some wit and take attention away from your gut, not win a debating prize. Look at other things to place beside you; the room, for instance.

YOU: My stomach hasn’t grown. The plates are smaller.

 
Ooh, better not. Your interlocutor could reply that the plates aren’t small enough in your case. So try the jerk’s petty mind.

YOU: That minuscule brain of yours makes everything look big.

All right. That works, in a crude way. To do it yourself, find a contrasting object or person, then blame it. You can even be logical. For example, the United States is losing its first-place status among developed nations on a whole variety of fronts, from productivity to health to education. A contraster helps to calm anxious Americans: we’re not deteriorating; they’re improving.

Now we will move up from things to whole concepts. The contraster uses one thing to make another seem different. It can also work with ideas or events. To change a concept, put another concept next to it to make it seem better or worse. This next quote—by Slate’s Jacob Weisberg—may seem a bit dated, but this sharp piece of political figuring shows how well the contraster works.

WEISBERG: In 1994, Gingrich had the Contract with America. In 2006, Democrats will have another glass of merlot.

Oh, how awful, a Democrat says. Besides, the party won back Congress that year. So either the Democrats got their act together or a little imbibing did the body politic good.

UNWRITTEN: The Democrats aren’t doing much to win the next election.

The contraster puts two concepts on a scale and lets it tip. We’ll do it again, with slightly more subtlety. This time we’ll use a great Billy Crystal line from the 1991 movie City Slickers.

CRYSTAL: Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place.

UNWRITTEN: Men don’t need a reason for sex. Just give them a place to do it.

The unwritten version goes straight at the point: men want sex all the time. By bringing in women, Billy Crystal sets up a funny, wise line.
