## What is micro-fiction?
A micro-fiction piece is a story told in 300 or fewer words. It’s a subset of flash fiction, which limits stories to 1000 words.

Ernest Hemingway wrote the most famous micro-story. He used only six words:
> For sale: baby shoes, never worn.

The challenge of writing a micro-story is to make every word count. You must pick meaningful words and build strong sentences.

## The structure of a micro-story
Like any other fiction piece, a micro-story has a sequence: a beginning, a middle, and an end. It includes a twist or a conflict: either it’s a change in the character (character arc) or a twist in the plot. The micro-story also has a scenario, which doesn’t need much detail - you don’t have enough length to incorporate descriptions.

## A step-by-step to draft a micro-story
### 1. Chose a primary emotion
When reading a fiction piece, readers want emotion; they want to feel something. In 300 words or less, you are limited to offer them that. You can’t extrapolate in many emotions or into a complex plot. You have to be direct.

The trick to incite emotion in less than 300 words is to focus on a single one. The emotion you choose will be your starting point for writing your micro-story.

> Find the key emotion; this may be all you need to find your short story. ~~ F. Scott Fitzgerald

### 2. Define the conflict
Your story will not have subplots: you must be direct and concise.

After choosing the key-emotion, elaborate the conflict around it. Make it simple and focused. Narrow down your idea as much as possible, using a tunnel vision.

### 3. Chose your character(s)
The ideal is to choose up to two characters, more than that will call for an extensive explanation — which you can’t afford.

Your character must be attractive: a physical characteristic, a peculiarity in the voice, a strong or enigmatic attitude.

If you name your character(s), choose short names, to maintain the “micro-vibe”.

### 4. Select your scene(s)
At this point, you have the key-emotion, the conflict, and the character(s). The scene is where you will combine all.

If you have more than one scene, select one as primary and offer the reader a detail about it. Leave the second one vaguer or include it as a midday shadow: barely perceptible.

> For me, good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. ~~ Stephen King, On Writing

### 5. Chose only one POV
Micro-fiction uses a single point of view (POV); there’s not enough word-counting to swap POV without losing the coherence of the story.

Chose either the 1st limited or 3rd person limited POV as they perform better in connecting the reader to the characters.

## How to write a micro-story
### Start by the conflict
In a micro-story, there is no space for descriptions, backstory or character-building; you start writing in the middle: straight to the conflict.

### Focus on the character arc
Flat characters offer nothing to readers. Something must happen to your character: a drastic event, a deep emotion, a discovery. He/she must end the story different from when it started.

In the end, the character should feel or do something different he/she was doing before.

### Write your story as long as you wish
Like any other first draft, your’s will be a micro-story told with many unnecessary words.

To elaborate your micro-story, write everything that comes up in your mind: describe the emotions, the scenarios, the characters. The goal is to form the story inside you, to feel it.

Only writing everything down, you’ll be able to choose what’s relevant and what’s not.

### Cut the fluff
Now that you wrote the first draft, it’s time to cut!

The remaining wording in your story will be the ones that matter, that adds value and significance into your story.

### Polish each sentence
The last step in writing a micro-fiction story is to polish the sentences.

Each word must contain meaning: an emotion, an action, a detail. The sentences should also have a meaning in itself but also as part of a whole, it actively builds up the story.

Ensure your first and last sentences are the strongest, they are the entrance and the exit of the story. The first sentence will hook readers to continue reading; the last one will make them chew on your story. And even re-read it, to savour it one more time.

### Create an appealing title
The title is the presentation, the promise of what’s coming: the title is the first impression of your story.

Name your story, revealing the theme, but not giving away any event.

### Enjoy the process and keep practising
Writing micro-fiction is a challenge, but — in my modest opinion — one of the best challenges in the writing set.

Once you try it, you will come for more. With practice, your first drafts will become shorter; they will be the closest version of your final draft.

Writing micro-fiction it’s an effective way to hone your writing skills: it demands focus and use of strong verbs and emotional words. Your writing will evolve into a sharper and concise version.

## Ephemeral Encounter
The empty bed holds their bodies’ warmth; the pillows release their fragrances through the room.

Their body shapes, framed in the sheets, is the only proof they were real.

The memories they build were ephemeral.

Their inexistence is now eternal.

## The Wind Blew
She stands by the sea, alone. The wind pushes, her hair shakes vigorously.

She hides her face beneath the long curly hair.

The wind grows stronger, blowing encouraging words. She must be comforted.

Her hair flicks, covers her eyes, silence her lips.

The wind insists, she has to listen! She has to feel it. It throws a gust, her body tenses, trying to hold to the ground.

The blowing of the wind is deafening. But she resists, she refuses to listen to its emotional words.

Persistent, the wind blows, blows, blows!

She remains impenetrable.

Suddenly, her body becomes lighter, her hair falls into her shoulders, silence surrounds her.

The wind gave up.

## She Is Danger
In front of the mirror, she takes off her clothes; piece by piece, layer by layer.

He follows her slow-paced movements in the reflex, admiring her curves, her flawless skin. The sensuality she emanates hypnotizes him.

When the last piece off clothing falls in the pile, she turns to him. Her beauty is no longer a reflected image.

She walks in his direction; each step throws him deeper on the sofa. His breathing is heavy, his clothes are his armour but also a jail cell.

She annihilates the distance between them. Her spiced fragrance torments him, his senses are submissive. He constricts his body, sending an order of restraint.

She whispers ‘Make me yours.’

She is danger, he should run.

He doesn’t.
