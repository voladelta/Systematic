## Identify Moments
- Duration Neglect — forget or ignore the length of the experience
- Peaks — high points, matter more for long experiences
- Peak-end Rule — become more relevant for short experiences
- Transitions — beginnings and endings

> The surprise about great service is mostly forgettable and occasionally remarkable.

Defining moments are created from one or more of the four elements:
- Elevation — memorable delight
- Insight — understanding of ourselves or the world
- Pride — moments of achievement or courage
- Connection — when we share them with others

**Create Moments**
Some examples of moments:
- Rituals / Fresh Starts
- Transitions — promotion, first days, end of projects
- Milestones — birthdays, anniversaries, 10k steps, can be anything
- Pits — low points can be filled with great experiences

> Every great service company is a master of service recovery.
> To maximize customer satisfaction, he said, you don’t want to be perfect. You want to get two things wrong, have the customer bring those mistakes to your attention, and then hustle like mad to fix those problems.

## Structure of Moments
- Boost sensory appeal.
- Raise the stakes.
- Break the script.
Ideally, you have all three, but you need at least two.

### Moments of Elevation
Moments of elevation are experiences that rise above the everyday. Times to be savored. Moments that make us feel engaged, joyful, amazed, motivated. They are peaks.

Moments of elevation can be social occasions that mark transitions: birthday parties, retirement parties, bar/bat mitzvahs, quinceañeras, and weddings.

Then there are other moments of elevation where we feel elevated by virtue of being “onstage,” so to speak: competing at sporting events, giving a presentation, performing in a play. The stakes are higher. We’re absorbed in the moment.

Finally, there are moments of elevation that happen spontaneously: The unplanned road trip. The walk on a sunny day that leaves you smiling. The first touch of a lover’s hand.

Most business try to fill the potholes and create complaint-free services, but it’s not about being complaint-free it’s about creating extraordinary service.

NPS — you work on improving the experience of the “neutral” not the “demoters”
- Boost sensory appeal — “turning up the volume”, things look better, taste better, sound better or feel better than they usually do — music, flowers, clothes
- Raise Stakes — add element of productive pressure: competition, game, performance, deadline, public commitment

One simple diagnostic to gauge whether you’ve transcended the ordinary is if people feel the need to pull out their cameras. If they take pictures, it must be a special occasion. (Not counting the selfie addict, who thinks his face is a special occasion.) Our instinct to capture a moment says: I want to remember this. 

Beware the soul-sucking force of “reasonableness”. Otherwise you risk deflating your peaks. Speed bumps are reasonable. Mount Everest is not reasonable.

Breaking the script—defying people’s expectations of how an experience will unfold. Breaking the script isn’t just surprise, it’s strategic surprise. 
- apply randomness — consistently enough that it matters, not so consistent that people get used to it

> The secret to growing a business is to “reduce negative variance and increase positive variance.”

> Tip to live longer life: Scare the hell our of yourself, regularly.

Reminiscine bump — we remember age 15–30 best, because of all the times we were pushed outside our comfort zone.

> We feel most comfortable when things are certain, we feel most alive when they’re not.

### Moments of Insight
**Tripping over the truth** is an insight that packs an emotional wallop. When you have a sudden realization, one that you didn’t see coming, and one that you know viscerally is right, you’ve tripped over the truth. It’s a defining moment that in an instant can change the way you see the world.

People in the audience discover the truth for themselves. In turn, that discovery makes the need for action obvious. 

This three-part recipe—a (1) clear insight (2) compressed in time and (3) discovered by the audience itself—provides a blueprint for us when we want people to confront uncomfortable truths.

You can’t appreciate the solution until you appreciate the problem. So when we talk about “tripping over the truth,” we mean the truth about a problem or harm. That’s what sparks sudden insight.

Self-understanding comes slowly. One of the few ways to accelerate it—to experience more crystallizing moments—is to **stretch for insight**.

Mentors push, mentees stretch. If you mentor someone—a student, an employee, a relative—you might wonder about the best way to give them a productive push. 

A good starting place is a two-part formula: high standards + assurance. Giving wise criticism:  “*I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know you can reach them.*” or "*I know you’re capable of great things if you’ll just put in the work.*"

What great mentors do is add two more elements: direction and support. *I have high expectations for you and I know you can meet them. So try this new challenge and if you fail, I’ll help you recover.*

### Moments of Pride
There are three practical principles we can use to create more moments of pride: (1) Recognize others; (2) Multiply meaningful milestones; (3) Practice courage. The first principle creates defining moments for others; the latter two allow us to create defining moments for ourselves.

Conducting a gratitude visit —a small investment that yields a large reward—is the defining feature of **recognition**.

Hitting a **milestone** sparks pride. It should also spark a celebration—a moment of elevation. (Don’t forget that milestones, along with pits and transitions, are three natural defining moments that deserve extra attention.) Milestones deserve peaks.

Success comes from pushing to the finish line. What milestones do is compel us to make that push, because (a) they’re within our grasp, and (b) we’ve chosen them precisely because they’re worth reaching for. Milestones define moments that are conquerable and worth conquering.

We’re not stuck with just one finish line. By multiplying milestones, we transform a long, amorphous race into one with many intermediate “finish lines.” As we push through each one, we experience a burst of pride as well as a jolt of energy to charge toward the next one.

Your moment of **courage** might be a defining moment for someone else—a signal to them that red is red, that wrong is wrong, and that it can be righted if we stand, together, against it.

### Moments of Connection
> Laughter is more about relationships than humor.  We laugh to tie the group together. "I’m with you. I’m part of your group." Our laughter says

In groups, we are constantly assessing the reactions and feelings of the group. Our words and glances are a kind of social sonar. Are you still there? Are you hearing what I’m hearing? Are your reactions like mine? Laughing in groups is another way of sending positive signals back and forth. We are synchronizing our reactions.

To create moments of connection, we can bring people together for a synchronizing moment. We can invite them to share in a purposeful struggle. The final strategy centers on connecting them to a larger sense of meaning.

> Passion is individualistic. It can energize us but also isolate us, because my passion isn’t yours. By contrast, purpose is something people can share. It can knit groups together.

Organizational leaders should learn to cultivate purpose—to unite people who might otherwise drift in different directions, chasing different passions. Purpose can be cultivated in a moment of insight and connection. 

Our relationships are stronger when we perceive that our partners are responsive to us. (The term used frequently is “perceived partner responsiveness.”)

Responsiveness encompasses three things:
- Understanding: My partner knows how I see myself and what is important to me.
- Validation: My partner respects who I am and what I want.
- Caring: My partner takes active and supportive steps in helping me meet my needs.

Notice how much of the recipe is about attunement. We want our partners to see us the way we see ourselves, and we want them to accept us and to help us get what we want. It’s incredibly selfish, frankly—me, me, me! It’s reciprocal selfishness, actually, since our partner expects the same.
