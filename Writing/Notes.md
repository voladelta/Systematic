### For clear writing, answer these questions
1. What am i really trying to say ?
2. Why should people care ?
3. What is the most important point ?
4. What is the easiest way to understand the most important point ?
5. How do i want the reader to feel ?
6. What should the reader do next ?

### Show, don't tell
Show emotion. Tell feelings.

Don't tell us "she was sad". Show us "Her lips trembled, and her eyes burned as she tried to keep her tears at bay".

Don't show us "Her eyelids were heavy, too heavy. Her limps could barely function and she couldn't stop yawning". Tell us 'She felt tired that morning'.

Showing emotion will bring the reader closer to the characters, to understand their reactions better. But i don't need to read about how slow she was moving due to tiredness.

Likewise, when you do show, keep it to a max 3 sentences. 2 paragraphs of 'how she was sad', with no inner thought or dialouge is just as boring.

### Five characteristics of high-converting headlines
1. Use numbers.
2. Use around 8 words if people are familiar and up to 18 if they’re not.
3. Use neutral or negative words; avoid positive superlatives.
4. Use a two-part model—headline and sub-headline.
5. Be crystal clear.


### Three headline formulas that work
#### Say what it is
The brain is a questioning organ. Whenever we see something new, our brain asks, “What is it?” This formula addresses that fundamental question.

- AirBnB: “Book unique places to stay and things to do.”
- Rocket Mortgage: “A simpler way to buy a home or refinance.”
- Bear Mattress: “Mattresses Designed to Improve Your Sleep”

#### Say what you get
This formula is a benefit-oriented statement that sums up what you get when you sign up.

- Otterbox: “Less laboring. More outdoorsing.”
- LendingPoint: “Get the Credit You Deserve”
- ConvertKit: “Connect with your audience. Make a living doing work you love.”

#### Say what you’re able to do (with it)
This is where the headline makes it clear what you’re able to accomplish if you use this product or service

- Songkick: “Find your perfect concert in ______.”
- Next Big Sound: “Grow through the power of Pandora.”
- Crazy Egg: “Make your website better. Instantly.”


### Better than a headline: Make it a unique value proposition
The value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline, and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero image, graphics).

There is no one right way to go about it. I suggest you start with the following formula:

- **Headline**. What is the end-benefit you’re offering in one short sentence? It can mention the product and/or customer. Make it an attention grabber.
- **Sub-headline or a 2–3 sentence paragraph**. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom, and why it’s useful.
- **3 bullet points**. List the key benefits or features.
- **Visual**. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product image, the hero shot, or an image reinforcing your main message.

Evaluate your current value proposition by checking whether it answers the questions below:
- What product or service is your company selling?
- What is the end-benefit of using it?
- Who is your target customer for this product or service?
- What makes your offering unique and different?

**Remember**: People scan; they don’t read. The structure I just described is extremely scan-friendly and enables to you to quickly deliver your main message to visitors.


### Value Propositions That Work
1. **Best quality**. Richard Branson once said that being the best at something is a pretty good business model, and I agree. Think of brands that set a standard, like Louisville baseball bats, Benjamin Moore paints, and Stradivarius violins. 
2. **Best bang for the buck**. Recessionary woes have amplified the fact that some consumers will always buy on price. Best-in-class value doesn’t always mean lowest price, however, but rather the best quality-to-price ratio. Jet Blue is a good example of a company that, though it may not offer the cheapest or best in comfort travel, does a good job of communicating its value relative to its price point.
3. **Luxury and aspiration**. On the other end of the spectrum from bang-for-buck players are luxury providers that promise the experience of a wealthy lifestyle to aspirational consumers. Ralph Lauren is one of the masters of a lifestyle luxury brand; others are Rolex, BMW, and Hermes.
4. **Must-have**. One of the most attractive value propositions we have seen and studied are the “must-haves.” These include basic goods — certain foods, for instance. During my prior work with Thomson Reuters, we often talked about “must-have” content that business professionals could not do their jobs without. The critical legal information and tools WestLaw provides to lawyers are an example. As long as there are legal cases, there will be a need for legal information.

### Action, Background, Development, Climax, and Ending
> _“You begin with_ **_action_** _that is compelling enough to draw us in, make us want to know more._ **_Background_** _is where you let us see and know who these people are, how they've come to be together, what was going on before the opening of the story. Then you_ **_develop_** _these people, so that we learn what they care most about. The plot - the drama, the actions, the tension - will grow out of that. You move them along until everything comes together in the_ **_climax_**_, after which things are different for the main characters, different in some real way. And then there is the_ **_ending_**_: what is our sense of who these people are now, what are they left with, what happened, and what did it mean?” - Anne Lamott_
