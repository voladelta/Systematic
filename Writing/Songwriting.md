Addiction has two components: Gratification (getting
something that hooks you) and Anticipation (waiting
for more Gratification).
- Make the gratification parts increasingly satisfying to hook the audience and keep them coming back (these will typically be our choruses),
- Keep the periods of anticipation (or verses) interesting enough so we don’t bore our audiences, and
- Find the perfect moments to switch between anticipation & gratification - if too much time passes, people will get bored and zone out; switch too quickly, and they will get confused.

The act structure
1) Setup, where we are introduced to the hero and his
problem (sometimes called the inciting incident).
2) Confrontation, where the shit hits the fan. Our hero’s
attempts to bring the adventure to a halt only result in
more complications.
3) Resolution, where the hero has to face his ultimate obstacle, and in doing so either succeeds or fails. 

The most popular energy curve in pop music by far is the “Hollywood Curve”. A song written with the Hollywood Formula is structured as follows: Intro, verse, verse cont., pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, prim. bridge, prim. bridge cont., chorus, chorus, outro. 

The golden mean or 1-2-3 rule says that after you have introduced something, repeat it once, then change it.
