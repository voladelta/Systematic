## Write Headlines

What makes a great headline is getting someone to do three things at the exact same time: 

1. Easily understand what this piece of writing is about 
2. Easily understand who this piece of writing is for 
3. And easily understand the PROMISE: the problem that will be solved, and/or the solution being offered 
 
This is what’s known as The Curiosity Gap. 

> The Curiosity Gap is what tells the reader what this piece of writing is about, who it’s for, and what it’s promising— **all without revealing the answer**.

When it comes to headlines, writers will often aim to write something “creative” or “clever,” failing to realize that true creativity is actually the art of clarity. If you’re vague, people won’t know what it is you’re writing about. If you’re unspecific, they won’t know it’s for them. And if your PROMISE isn’t compelling enough, they won’t give it any attention. 

For example, a headline like “The Big Idea” is ineffective because it doesn’t tell the reader 1) what it’s about, 2) who it’s for, or 3) what it’s promising in exchange. 

Here’s how we fix it:
- “The Big Idea That Needs To Get Through Politicians’ Heads To Fix Racial Inequality In America” is clearer. As a reader, you now know exactly what this piece is about. 

- “3 Big Ideas From Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, And Jeff Bezos That Changed The World Forever” is more specific. If you’re interested in creativity and business, you know this article was written for you.

- “This 1 Big Idea Will Change The Way You Think About College” is a big PROMISE. This headline tells the reader, “The way you think about college will no longer be the same after you read this article.”

And you better deliver on that PROMISE—otherwise readers are going to call your writing “clickbait.” 

(People think “clickbait” refers to the headline style that uses numbers: 7 Things, 6 Ways, 3 Mistakes, etc. It’s not. These headline styles are extremely effective as long as you keep your PROMISE to the reader. It’s when you don’t keep your PROMISE that the reader feels tricked—which leaves them disappointed, angry, and “click-baited.”)

Now, there are definitely some lazy, overly sensational examples of The Curiosity Gap that writers on the internet use all the time, and I don’t recommend them. 
- “You’ll Never Believe What Happened Next!” 
- “This CRAZY Situation Couldn’t Have Gotten ANY WORSE” 
- “The Secret No One Wants You To Know...”

“Better,” less clickbaity examples of The Curiosity Gap would be headlines that more articulately speak to the intended audience, problem, and PROMISE. 
- “The 1 Mistake All New Project Managers Make—And It Ends Up Costing Their Company $500,000” 
- “7 Small But Meaningful Things You Can Say To Your Significant Other To Show How Much You Love Them”
- “How To Write Headlines That Go Viral, Accumulate Millions Of Page Views, And Convert Readers Into Loyal Customers”

What makes these headlines so powerful isn’t that they’re “creative” or “clever.” They’re powerful because they are clear in their intentions. You know exactly what each one of these pieces is going to be about before you even click on it—which means, if a reader does choose to click on an article, they didn’t arrive there on accident. Something about the headline spoke to them (and the more you write, and the more data you accumulate, you will begin to know which types of headlines speak to your target readers most effectively).

Expert-level examples of The Curiosity Gap are headlines that find new, unique ways to achieve these same three goals but by using new language, structures, or formats. Best-selling books do this masterfully. They combine an overarching main title with an ultra-specific subtitle to create a puzzle of intrigue.

**Nonfiction Examples**
- “Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way To Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones”
- “The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, And Join The New Rich”
- “Play Bigger: How Pirates, Dreamers, And Innovators Create And Dominate Markets”

**Fiction Examples**
- “The Book Thief” (Look at how much you can imagine about the story based off just those three words!)
- “Ready Player One” (Immediately tells gamers, “This is a book for you.”)
- “The Martian” (When paired with a photo of a human on Mars, the reader immediately knows “The Martian” isn’t some otherworldly creature inhabiting earth—it’s actually about a human inhabiting another planet.)

What these titles have in common is they are executing The Curiosity Gap with two puzzle pieces instead of just one. On the nonfiction side, “Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, And Join The New Rich” is a great headline. But it’s a “better” headline by adding “The 4-Hour Workweek” in front of it. There’s a clearer benefit, another PROMISE. And on the fiction side, the entire story arc is told in two or three carefully chosen words. It’s not just that the title is “catchy.” The reason these titles work is because the reader actually gets all three of their questions answered clearly: 
1. What is this about? 
2. Is this for me? 
3. What PROMISE are you making—and how confident am I in your ability to deliver on that PROMISE?

#### Who Are You Writing For? 

Before you start writing anything, the very first thing you should do is think deeply about the headline, the frame, and the focal point you are presenting to your reader. 

*Even if you’re writing a 100-character Tweet, I encourage you to question, “What would be the headline of this Tweet?” *

To be honest, I used to write my headlines last. A younger me believed what mattered more was the content of what I was saying, and that the headline was basically just the bow I placed on top. Seven years later, I realized this was not only incorrect, but incredibly unproductive. Your headline isn’t just a headline. Your headline is, quite literally, a micro-version of your entire Actionable Guide, Opinion, Curated List, Story, or Credibility.

If you can’t clearly communicate what it is you want to say in a twelve-word headline, chances are, you won’t clearly communicate what it is you want to say in an 800-word post (or a 60,000-word book). 

**The first question I encourage you to ask yourself is, “Who is this piece of writing for?”**

One of the biggest ironies when it comes to online writing is that people think Audience and Subject Matter are two completely separate variables. They sit down to write whatever it is they want to write, and then, after the fact, they say, “Ok now how do I get this in front of a billion people?”

What these writers fail to realize is that Subject Matter is actually what defines the size of their Audience.

> The size of your audience is a direct reflection of the **size of the question you’re answering**.

For example, very few people wake up in the morning and say to themselves, “Wow, I wonder what’s new in the world of biotechnology.” Biotechnology is a niche. Which means, if you’re writing about what’s happening within the world of biotechnology, your Audience will only be *as big as the number of people actively asking themselves about* biotechnology.

However, a lot more people wake up in the morning and ask themselves, “How can I be happier in life? How do I know if I’m in a healthy relationship? How can I make more money?” 

These broader, more universal questions have much larger Audiences—which means, by choosing Happiness, Relationships, or Money as your Subject Matter, you will inherently reach a wider Audience.

Before you begin writing anything, you need to decide who you are writing for. And that decision needs to be clearly reflected in both the headline and the content of your piece.

**Are you writing for the masses?** Do you want to try to reach as many people as possible? Then you need to answer a universal question—something that will resonate with anyone, no matter who they are or where they’re from.

**Are you writing for a specific niche?** Are you less concerned with reaching “everyone,” and more concerned with reaching a specific type of person? Then you need to *answer a question highly relevant to that niche* — something that will resonate meaningfully with your exact target reader (for example: someone deep in the field of biotechnology).

This is true for both fiction and nonfiction. A story titled, “The Day Humans Went Extinct” answers a much broader question (“What happens if every human goes extinct?”) than a story titled, “The Day Vampires Went Extinct.” Why? Because the number of people who want to know about the future of humans is much larger than the number of people who want to know about the future of vampires. And even less people want to read a story titled, “The Day Caterpillar-Vampires Went Extinct.” As the size of the question gets smaller, and the niche gets more specific, so does the size of your potential Audience.

**Now, there is a way for you to get the best of both worlds, and that’s by using niche topics to answer universal questions.**

For example, an article titled, “How To Be A Better Writer” answers two of our three questions. You know who this article is going to be for, and you know what it’s going to be about. Unfortunately, the PROMISE is a little weak. What does being a “better writer” really mean? What benefits do you receive by becoming a better writer? Why should someone want to become a “better writer” in the first place? 

Here is where you have a decision to make. You can either make your PROMISE answer a niche question or a broad question—and depending on which you pick will dramatically change the size of your potential Audience. (It will also change the content of the piece.)

For example: 

**“How To Be A Better Writer Today, So You Can Start Writing Best-Selling Books Tomorrow”** would be a title with a big PROMISE for aspiring authors. If you have no interest in becoming a best-selling author, you probably won’t want to read this piece of writing. It’s more specific, and will resonate more clearly with your target reader, but it won’t reach as many different types of readers. This is the pro/con.

**“How To Become A Better Writer, Journal More Often, And Live A More Present Life”** on the other hand, has a completely different PROMISE. The question it’s answering is dramatically bigger (“How can I live a more present life?”). The Curiosity Gap here is saying that by becoming a better writer, and using writing as a habit, you can live a more present life—if you click and read to find out how.

This technique of tying niche topics to universal questions is a powerful way of tapping into new audiences and expanding your reach outside of your particular industry or category.

**Here are a few more examples:**
- “The Future Of The Biotechnology Industry” is niche (and vague), and can be expanded by changing it to “How The Future Of Biotechnology Is Going To Make All Of Us Happier, Healthier, And Live Longer.”

- “The Girl Who Ran Away” is good, but it can be clarified and expanded by changing it to, “The Girl Who Ran Away: Family, Loss, And The Power Of Forgiving Those Who Hurt You Most.”

- “7 Tips For Becoming Smarter” is clear, but a bigger PROMISE can help it reach more people. “7 Tips For Becoming Smarter, Achieving Chess-Master Memory, And Becoming The Most Interesting Person In The Room”

To recap: 
• Bigger Questions attract Bigger Audiences 

• Niche Questions attract Niche Audiences 

• Wider Audiences benefit from simple, universal language 

• Niche Audiences benefit from ultra-specific, niche language 

• Titles that only answer 1 of the 3 questions are weak. Titles that answer 2 of the 3 questions are good. Titles that answer all 3 of the questions are exceptional

### Pieces Of A Perfect Headline 
**The 1** {Question} *That Gets* Every Single Millennial {In Trouble}

This is a headline from an article I wrote for Inc Magazine that ended up accumulating over 200,000 views. It ended up attracting a lot of attention from other publications, smaller blogs, and even podcasters, all of whom wanted to have a debate about Millennials in the workforce.

To clearly explain what makes a headline great, we need to examine each of the pieces within a headline by itself—so you can see how they fit into the whole. I’ve coded the above headline with different symbols (bold, italic, and {}), so we can get into the weeds here and talk about each piece of the sentence.

**The 1**

The first two or three words of a headline are arguably the most important words of the sentence. When people are scrolling through titles, they really only look at the beginning and the end. They want to know what this “thing” is (the beginning), and what will happen (the end/the PROMISE) if they read it—all in a matter of milliseconds. The beginning of this headline here immediately sets the tone: **The 1**. 

That’s it. 

There’s 1 and 1 only. 

There are two reasons this technique of using a number at the beginning of a headline is so effective. First, it conveys conviction, which readers trust. It’s declarative, and anything that is declarative implies a strong stance or opinion (which people love). Second, it sounds short. You’re not asking the reader to read about 10 different points, or 100 different points. You’re saying, “You just need to know this 1 thing,” which feels like a very low barrier to entry for a reader. 

“Meh, this will only take me a second to read,” they say to themselves, right before they click.

**{Question}** 

Next, The 1 has to describe something. The 1… what? • Reason? 
• Way? 
• Solution? 
• Problem?

This part of the sentence is THE WHAT. It’s the carrot you dangle in front of the reader letting them know what they’re about to read. Without this in the sentence, every reader will subconsciously feel like the headline lacks clarity—and when you confuse, you lose. 

The real key to choosing the right word for this part of the headline is to think about what will stir up the most curiosity in your audience. 

This is the beginning of your Curiosity Gap.

**That Gets**

This is the part of the headline that connects the beginning to the end. 

Connecting pieces should be used sparingly. Nobody has time for a 20-word headline, and every additional word you add is one more step the reader needs to slog through in order to figure out what the headline is saying, who it’s for, and what they can expect to receive in exchange for reading it.

Now, based on your genre, category, or topic, you might not even need these connecting pieces. If you do, make sure to pick strong, descriptive words. For example, “Gets” is a conversational word, which works well for broader audiences, but truthfully (and this would mean shifting other words in the sentence), “Incentivizes” or “Pushes” or “Encourages” would be better words. They’re more descriptive.

**Every Single Millennial **

This is the WHO. 

WHO is this article for? Entrepreneurs? Artists? Millennials? Baby Boomers? And more importantly, within that demographic, WHO specifically? All of them? Some of them? One specific group of them? 

This is the part of the sentence that caters most to your target audience. Your WHO doesn’t have to be an age demographic. It could be a group of people joined together by an interest or even a place. In a title like “4 Things All Chicagoans Need To Do…,” the WHO is “Chicagoans,” which also implies a WHERE as well.

The two things you need to balance here are: 
- WHO—based on age, ethnicity, location, interest, etc. 
- WHO within that WHO—all of them? Some of them? 1% of them?

**{In Trouble}**

And finally, the ending—also known as THE PROMISE. 

This is what readers look for most. They want to know what happens in the story before they even read it. 

The key to writing a great PROMISE is to use language that elicits an emotional response. “Trouble” is a great word because nobody likes getting into trouble, yet everyone loves hearing about other people who get in trouble. 

The best way to come up with a compelling PROMISE is to think deeply about 1) outcomes your readers want to receive, or 2) outcomes your readers want to avoid.

For example: 
- “…Become Rich” is a good outcome, but “… Become So Rich You Never Have To Think About Money Again” is a far more emotional and exciting outcome. 

- “…Not Lose Your Job” is a general outcome most people want to avoid, but “…Not Get Fired On Your First Day” is a more specific, more easily imaginable outcome a lot of people actively worry about. 

- “…Get Married” is a standard outcome, but “… Get Married And Stay Together For More Than 20 Years” is an outcome the reader can measure.

The more emotional you can make your PROMISE, the more likely a reader is to want to read, comment, and share your writing.

Because it speaks to a part of their identity.

#### Proven Headline Formats 

Once you know how a headline is constructed, you can then start adding and subtracting different puzzle pieces to hook your target reader’s attention. 

There are a handful of headline formats that writers, major publications, and publishing houses use relentlessly—because they work. It’s the reason why nearly every Business Insider or Forbes article has a similar look and feel, and why each genre has its patterns. My recommendation for using these proven formats is to think of ways you can incorporate them into your individual style. 

Here are some of the most proven headline formats in online writing:
- **Big Numbers**: For example, “3,000 People Just Filed For Unemployment In This Small Town In Arkansas. Here’s Why.” This is a great headline because “3,000 People” is concrete, definitive, easy to imagine, and yet an unexpectedly large number—and what’s unexpected is exciting. 

- **Dollar Signs**: Money is about as universal as a topic can get. “$400 Million Is How Much You Need To Make In Order To Afford This Insane Mansion In Malibu” is eye-catching because very few people have $400 million. Dollar signs make the Curiosity Gap wider and more interesting for readers.

- **Credible Names**: Celebrities, CEOs, pop culture icons, anyone the world can easily recognize by name is a great way to hook readers’ attention. “Will Smith’s Advice On How To Live A Fulfilling Life Will Change The Way You See The World Forever” is a headline built on credibility. Yes, there’s a great PROMISE here, but the real “hook” comes from the fact that it’s advice via Will Smith. “Amazon, Apple, Tesla, And 4 Other Stocks That Have Made Early Investors Mega-Millionaires” is another example of how to leverage name credibility.

- “**This Just Happened**”: Timeliness is a terrific mechanism for getting readers’ attention right now. Words like “Just, Recently, Today, Now,” etc., are what tell a reader that of all the things on the internet to read, “this thing” is high priority. For example, “Michael Jordan Just Gave A Press Conference And NBA Executives Are Furious.” The reason you would want to read that article is to feel in-the-know.

- **The Success Story**: These headlines summarize an amazing event or rare occurrence that doesn’t happen every day. For example, “How This Small Team Managed To Secure A Six-Figure Investment In Less Than 1 Week” or “This 1 Group Activity Exercise Increased An Entire Office’s Productivity By 150%.”

- **Things That Shouldn’t Go Together**: Combining two or more things in a headline that don’t typically sit next to each other is a great way to force readers to pause and take an interest. For example, “7 Things KFC And Miley Cyrus Have In Common,” or, “What Jay-Z, Pablo Escobar, And Oprah Can Teach Us About Leadership.”

- **For The Industry**: These headlines work well when you’re writing for a very specific audience. So much so, that you want to call them out right in the title. The more specific you can be about who the piece is for, the better. For example, “3 Things All Successful Small Business Owners Do To Stay Profitable.”

- **The Topic Within The Topic**: Some headlines benefit from a bit of added curiosity. This is a technique that can be applied to any of the other headline structures, and can be a great way of making readers feel like they’re getting the “inside scoop.” For example, “7 Ways The Real Estate Industry Is Changing (And How You Should Be Investing Your Money).” The first part of the headline is a strong headline, but it’s the second part of the headline (inside parentheses) that gives the first part more context.

- **Question/Answer**: These headlines start with a question and end with a hint at the answer. This style is best suited for articles with a big concept that’s difficult to cram into one headline—but when split in two, you’re able to give more context to the reader, faster. For example, “Can’t Be Productive In The Office? Try Organizing Your Calendar Like This” or “Don’t Know How To Track Your Goals? This New App Has The Answer.”

- **X Number**: 1 Thing, 3 Ways, 5 Lessons, 9 Habits, etc. Placing a number at the beginning of a headline tells the reader, “This is all you’re signing up for—just 9 quick habits and then we’re done.” It makes the piece feel like there is a much lower barrier to entry, while at the same time setting a concrete expectation. The book, “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do” became an international bestseller using the same headline style that has powered so many articles online.

And of course, you can combine any of these proven formats to make your headlines even stronger. For example, “The 1 Thing LeBron James Does Every Morning That Earns Him An Extra $10 Million Per Year.” 

> BuzzFeed has a rule: **every writer must write 30 versions of a headline** in order to find the right one. 

All great headlines take time.

The first headline you write probably won’t be “it.” There’s a rewriting process that needs to happen in order to get rid of all the tiny words like “if, when, does, it, too, for,” etc., that get in the way of your headline achieving all three of its goals: 1) telling the reader what this piece is about, 2) whether it’s for them, and 3) whether the PROMISE is worth their time. 

The way I write and rewrite headlines is I first try to say whatever it is I’m trying to say, in as many words as I need to say it. 

*“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis In Order To Become The Best Person You Can Possibly Become, No Matter What Obstacles Are In Your Way”*

Next, I think hard about whether or not I’ve really nailed down the PROMISE. Can I PROMISE more? What else does the reader want? What are their emotional wants, needs, and desires related to this specific problem or piece of advice? 

*“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis In Order To Get More Done, Achieve Your Goals, And Start Living Your Best Life”*

Then, once I feel like I have clarity around the PROMISE, I look for words that are still too vague. I want the reader’s eyes to skim my headline and latch on to two or three words that speak directly to the categories of their interests. 

“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis To Be More **Productive**, Achieve **Success**, And Gain True Financial **Freedom**”

Finally, I’ll go through my headline and edit out as many tiny connecting words as possible. Less is more.

*“8 Daily Habits That Will Make You More Productive, Achieve Success, And Gain True Financial Freedom”*

If I get to the end of the exercise and I like the headline in its final form, I’ll go and write the piece. And if I went through the steps and felt like I didn’t end up with something powerful enough, I’ll start back at the beginning.

If you are a nonfiction writer, then I strongly encourage you to use these techniques in your online writing. Once you learn the formats, you’ll start to see them everywhere—from Medium articles to New York Times headlines. Again, I’m not advocating for you to sound like you’re a BuzzFeed columnist. All I’m doing is pointing out the techniques that work, so you can best decide how to mold them to match your own unique style.

And if you are a fiction writer, then I would encourage you to apply these techniques to your story titles, as well as your content marketing. If you want to write a sci-fi book, you should be writing articles online like, “8 Timeless Sci-Fi Characters That Defined The Genre Forever.” Because chances are, if someone is interested in reading an article like that, they’re also interested in new sci-fi stories—which you can subtly mention at the beginning or end of the piece.

#### POWER Phrases 

Lastly, you always want to be thinking about what “POWER phrases” you can add to your headlines to clarify the urgency and importance of whatever it is you’re writing about. 

For example, instead of saying “7 Ways…” you could say, “7 Little-Known Ways” or “7 Small But Powerful Ways.” These tiny tweaks are what tell readers that what they’re about to read is different from all the other articles on the same topic—and can also hint at a more meaningful or impactful PROMISE. 

A few examples:
- 3 **Crucial** Lessons About Business You’ll Learn Working For A High-Growth Startup Founder
- These **Unforgettable** Tips From Silicon Valley’s 10 Most Successful VC Firms Will Change The Way You Think About Business Forever
- 9 **Memorable** Truths About Life They Don’t Teach You In School

## Structure The Perfect Post

### Introductions
Right away in the introduction, your job is to answer all three of the reader’s preliminary questions: 
1. What is this about? 
2. Is this for me? 
3. What are you PROMISING me and how confi dent am I that you’re going to deliver on that PROMISE?

The very first sentence is arguably the most important sentence of the entire piece. 

It should be a short sentence. It should be a clear sentence. It should be a sentence that a reader can fly through, giving them the feeling that they’re off to a running start. You are successful if you can nail the entire “point” of the piece in ten words or less. 
- “Most people don’t believe me when I say I write 10,000 words per day, every day.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “How I Write 10,000 Words Per Day, Every Day.”
- “Success doesn’t happen in an instant.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “19 Tiny Habits That Lead To Huge Results.”
- “There are only 2 ways to become rich.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “The 1 Habit That Keeps 99% Of People From Ever Becoming Rich.” 

Once this sentence has answered the reader’s first question (“What is this about?”), you now have a very limited amount of time to answer their second and third questions—“Is this for me, and what are you PROMISING?” 

There are a handful of rhythms you can use to answer the remaining two questions and craft an effective introduction.

#### 1/3/1 

The 1/3/1 structure is the best place to start. 

In 1/3/1, you have one strong opening sentence, three description sentences, and then one conclusion sentence. Visually, this is a powerful way to tell the reader you aren’t going to make them suffer through big blocks of text, and that you have their best interests in mind. 

Here’s how it works: 

This first sentence is your opener. 

This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion. 

This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion.

**Here’s an example of the 1/3/1 structure from my article**, “How Do Some People Succeed So Quickly? They Approach Life Like This.” 

Life is all about perspective. 

The exact same situation can be perceived in very different ways by two different people. One might see loss — the other, opportunity. One might feel like a victim — the other, a changemaker. Which means, as far as “absolute” truths are concerned, the first step to becoming who you truly want to be in life means accepting the fact that how you see the world might not be the whole picture. 

So, if our life experience is based upon the way we see the world, then here are some small but incredibly impactful mental shifts that can help you see things from a new perspective. 

The last sentence of the 1/3/1 article should be both a conclusion and a transition into the next section of the article—your Main Points. This way, the reader feels as though they’ve reached their first “checkpoint” reading your piece (giving them a feeling of accomplishment) while also hinting at where you are going to take them next.

#### 1/5/1 

The 1/5/1 structure is the same as the 1/3/1 structure, just with more room for description and clarification in the middle. 

**Here’s how it works: **

This first sentence is your opener. 

This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. This fourth sentence builds on that credibility or description, giving added context or new information. This fifth sentence explains to the reader why you’re telling them what you’re telling them. And this sixth sentence drives home the point. 

This seventh sentence is your strong conclusion.

You want to use the 1/5/1 structure when your opener would benefit from additional context, or you want to tell a story that requires an extra sentence or two for clarification. However, once you start getting into 1/7/1 or 1/8/1 territory, you’re either trying to tackle too many different points all at once, or you are being unnecessarily descriptive. There are cases where having this big of a middle paragraph can work, but I would encourage you to stay away from it—and if you do, then your opener sentence and your conclusion sentence should be very short (to counterbalance the big block of text between them).

**Here’s an example of the 1/5/1 structure**, from my Inc Magazine article, “Being A Freelancer Is Not The Same As Being An Entrepreneur. Here’s Why.” 

> The dream before you take the leap to become a full-time entrepreneur is to have “work-life balance.” 
>
I remember back when I was working my 9-5, a little over a year ago. I had to commute an hour to work each way, which made my commitment closer to an 8-6. And then some days I would need to work late, which meant I wouldn’t leave until 7, or sometimes 8. I’d finally make it home, throw my backpack onto my bed, and sit in my desk chair with the sullen realization that the day was over. I had enough time to cook dinner and do a little late-night writing before passing out and repeating the same dance all over again. 
>
Becoming an entrepreneur, I thought, would give me more time to enjoy some of my other passions.

#### 1/3/2/1 & 1/5/2/1 

The basic structures of online writing are 1/3/1 and 1/5/1. Once you learn these, you can then start to play with rhythm a bit more and elongate your introductions. I cannot stress enough how much you *do not want* to elongate your writing by cramming sentence after sentence into one paragraph. Online writing benefits from clearly separated thoughts and statements, which is why I recommend using variations of the 1/3/1 and 1/5/1 structure if you need the extra space. 

Remember: you want to optimize for speed and Rate of Revelation. 

Anything that isn’t absolutely necessary, delete it.

**Here’s how it works:** 

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
>This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion. 
>
>This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion. And this sixth sentence is expanding on why you’re making such a strong conclusion. 
>
>This seventh sentence is what you’re going to talk about next.

Here, the 1/3/1 structure is being expanded ever so slightly into 1/3/2/1, without asking the reader to slog through too much additional description or explanation. And with the 1/5/2/1 structure, you’re doing the same thing just expanding it a tiny bit more. Notice, we are still keeping one single sentence as the opener, and one single sentence as the conclusion. This is to visually tell the reader, “You already read the first sentence, now there’s just this one big paragraph and then you can already see the conclusion sentence waiting for you.” 

When readers can “see” the end, they’re more likely to want to put in the effort to get there.

#### 1/4/1/1 

Why the 1/4/1/1 structure works so well is because now your single-sentence conclusion packs two punches instead of one. 

**Here’s how it works:** 

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
>This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. This fourth sentence rounds out your argument. And this fifth sentence speaks to the emotional benefit of the reader. 
>
>This sixth sentence is your conclusion. 
>
>And this seventh sentence is why that conclusion matters so much.

If you notice, the only difference between the 1/3/1 structure and 1/4/1/1 is rhythm. 

One more sentence doesn’t really change the content of the introduction. But the way the sentences are separated elicits a different response in the reader. The 1/3/1 structure feels strong, but 1/4/1/1 feels stronger, and even more 194 Chapter 8 opinionated—there are two punchlines instead of one. In fact, just by moving a single sentence up or down in any of these paragraphs can dramatically change the rhythm of your introduction.

**Here’s an example of the 1/4/1/1 structure from my article**, “6 Important Life Lessons You Can Only Learn Through Failure.” 

>Nobody learns the hard lessons in life without some element of failure. 
>
When we let someone down, we learn why. When we fall short of our own expectations, we become aware of our growth edge. When we crumble under pressure, we become attuned to our weaknesses. There is a “lesson” inside each and every defeat — and those who ultimately reach their goals see these moments as valuable opportunities, not punishments. 
>
>Unfortunately, that doesn’t make the learning process any less painful. 
>
>There are some lessons in life you just can’t learn without falling down, scraping both knees, and getting back up again.

Like the other structures above, you can elongate your introduction by adding a bit more text in the first major paragraph. 1/5/1/1 works, and so does 1/6/1/1. But once you start getting up into 1/7/1/1, you’re asking a bit much of your reader—meaning they’re less likely to make it through your introduction.

#### 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 

Now, let’s say you need to write a hefty introduction. (I use the word “need” very specifically here, because unless there’s a real reason for your introduction to be longer than seven-or-so sentences, you should err on the side of brevity and kill a few more of your darlings.) 

A “trick” for making a long introduction seem short is by repeating the first 1/3/1 structure over again, connecting them with a subhead.

**Here’s how it works:** 

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument. 
>
This fifth sentence is your conclusion. 
>
Now, here’s a new first sentence as a second opener. 
>
And this second sentence clarifies your second opener. This third sentence reinforces the new point you’re making—with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out the second point of your argument. 
>
This fifth sentence is the big conclusion of your introduction.

Now, unless you knew what to look for here, you might read a piece structured this way and think, “Well that’s just a long introduction.” But there’s a lot happening beneath the surface that makes an introduction like this work— specifically how it moves the reader quickly down the page. 

The other reason why repeating the 1/3/1 structure works so well is because it forces you, the writer, to be conscious and clear about what you’re trying to accomplish in each section. Within the first five sentences of the piece, what are you trying to say? What’s the one singular point you’re trying to drive home? What’s this story really about? And then, again in the second 1/3/1 section, what’s the new point you’re looking to drive home? Why is this also important to the reader? Does it really warrant having its own section? 

Thinking in “chunks” like this is how you make your writing more potent. And readers love writing that doesn’t waste their time. 

**Here’s an example of the 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 structure from my article**, “8 Soft Skills You Need To Work At A High-Growth Startup.”

>It takes a certain type of personality to want to work at a startup — and the crucial qualities of startup employees you decide to hire. 
>
When I was 26 years old, one of my closest friends and I decided we were going to start a company. He was still in the process of finishing his MBA. I had recently taken the leap from my job as a copywriter working in advertising. And every few weeks he would fly to Chicago (where I was based), or I would fly to Atlanta (where he was based), and we’d trade off sleeping on each other’s couches while brainstorming what our first step was going to be. 
>
We called it Digital Press. 
>
I’ll never forget the day we decided to make our first hire. 
>
He was a freelance writer recommended to me by a friend — and we were in the market to start hiring writers and editors (to replace the jobs my co-founder, Drew, and I were performing ourselves). We asked him to meet us at Soho House in Chicago, ordered a bottle of red wine to share, and “interviewed” him by the pool on the roof. He was a fiction writer with a passion for fantasy and sci-fi (not business writing, which was what we needed), and we were young and inexperienced just hoping someone would trust us enough to follow our vision. 
>
We hired him — and fired him two months later.

The last thing I want to point out here is that you can actually make the 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 structure move even faster by combining the last sentence of the first section, and the first sentence of the second section, into one singular subhead.

**Here’s how it works: **

> This first sentence is your opener. 
> 
> This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument. 
> 
> **This fifth sentence is both your conclusion and the first sentence of your second section.**
> 
> And this sixth sentence clarifies your second opener. This seventh sentence reinforces the new point you’re making—with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this eighth sentence rounds out the second point of your argument. 
> 
> This ninth sentence is the big conclusion of your introduction.

Visually, this is so much easier to read. The subhead alone chops what could have been a very long introduction into a bunch of small, digestible bites—and the subhead grabs the reader’s attention in a way that lets them know their first “milestone” is just a few sentences down. Writers who don’t use subheads are significantly disadvantaged when it comes to writing online, because a reader’s eyes naturally “look” for subheads more than they do full paragraphs and blocks of text. 

Written content online with no subheads feels exhausting. 

Lists with a lot of subheads, on the other hand, feel easy and convenient.

#### 1/3/1 + Bullets

Once you’ve mastered the basics of writing clean, organized, and rapid introductions, you can then start to step out of the box and use other writing techniques to get readers flying down the page. 

For example, readers love bulleted lists. 

This is a technique that works extremely well for your Main Points, but there’s also no reason why you can’t use it within your introduction as well. A bulleted list is just a faster, more efficient way to cram a ton of value into a very short amount of time. The key here isn’t to just list things for listing’s sake, but to think about what would otherwise take five or more sentences to write out, and to communicate that same information faster in a bulleted list. 

**Here’s how it works: **

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument.
>
This fifth sentence is your conclusion, as well as the subhead to your bulleted list. 
• Point #1 
• Point #2 
• Point #3 
• Point #4 
• Etc...

Now, bulleted lists can backfire when not used properly, so let me make this very clear. Lists, when combined with sub-par information, come off as weak, boring, and a waste of time. It’s not the listing of things that readers enjoy. What they enjoy is being given a ton of valuable and relevant information in a compressed amount of time. Your job isn’t to just “list” stuff. It’s to take what otherwise would be a long-winded section and compress it using a different form or technique.

**Here’s an example of the 1/3/1 + Bullets structure from my article**, “5 Serious Things You Should Know About Money Before You Turn 30.” 

>Money, and “financial freedom,” is a skill. 
>
>No one ever tells you what you should know about money when you’re young. There isn’t a class in high school, or even college, where a professor sits you down and says, “Now listen up: mastering money is no different than learning how to shoot a basketball or paint a picture. It just takes practice.” 
>
>Instead, money remains (for many people) this massive unknown in their daily lives. 
>• They don’t know how to make more of it. 
>• They don’t know how to spend less of it. 
>• They don’t know how (they’ll ever) save it. 
>• And they don’t know what to do with it once they have it. 
>
>And that’s a big problem.

#### 1 + Subhead 

And finally, if you want to just get straight to the point, why waste any time? 

One sentence is all you need in order to frame the piece— before immediately hitting the reader with the first milestone and subhead. 

**Here’s how it works: **

>This first sentence is what the whole piece is about. 
>
**And this first subhead is what we’re going to dig into right here, right now.** 

I don’t recommend this technique for everything you write, but as a way to change things up, it can be a powerful mechanism for turning your Rate of Revelation knob to level 10.

**Here’s an example of the 1+ Subhead structure from my article**, “I Used To Have Social Anxiety. These 4 Mental Shifts Made Me Confident.” 

>Most people see confidence as something you’re born with — you either have it or you don’t. 
>
**But the truth is, confidence is just like any other personality trait.**
>
If you want to be more patient, you have to practice patience. If you want to be more compassionate, you have to practice compassion. If you want to be more thoughtful, you have to 202 Chapter 8 practice doing things intentionally. And if you want to be confident, well then, you simply have to practice being confident.

I’ve included the paragraph below the first subhead so you can see how the piece continues forward. The real strategy here is to make the reader feel like they’ve stepped into the middle of a piece by the time they’ve finished reading the very first sentence. There’s something jarring (in a good way) about seeing the second sentence of an article bolded as a subhead. It tells the reader, “We’re already getting to the good part,” encouraging them to keep reading.

#### To Recap
The types of introduction structures that work well are: 
• 1/3/1 
• 1/5/1 
• 1/3/2/1 
• 1/5/2/1 
• 1/4/1/1 
• 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 
• 1/3/Subhead/3/1 
• 1/3/1 + Bulleted List 
• 1/Subhead

Notice again how every single structure relies on a single opening sentence, and always ends with a single conclusion sentence. Pieces that open with two consecutive sentences in the first paragraph are weaker. And pieces that open with three or more sentences in the first paragraph are tiring for the reader. As much as possible, you want to crescendo and decrescendo your rhythms, starting Chapter 8 203 with one sentence, then moving up to three, four, or five sentences, then back down to two sentences, then back down to one—and repeat. 

This is what makes the reader feel like they’re riding a wave.

And waves feel good.

### Main Points

Once you’ve successfully framed what it is you’re writing about, it’s time to get into the Main Points of the piece. 

Your Main Points are, quite literally, why the reader clicked on your headline to begin with. In fact, it’s very common for readers to skim (or skip) the introduction of a piece and just start reading at the first Main Point. And it’s even more common for readers to not even read the article in its entirety. What they’ll do instead is skim the Main Points and subheads, and then decide whether it’s worth going back and reading the article in full. 

>If the “sweet spot” of an online article is 800 to 1,200 words, then your job as a writer is to pack as much value into your Main Points as possible— **without inflating the piece’s word count**. 

One of the biggest mistakes writers make when structuring their writing online is not thinking about how much “real estate” they’re giving each point. 

Which is why I encourage you to write backwards. 

Once you’ve written your introduction (or, even before you 204 Chapter 8 write your introduction), skeleton out your piece by listing your Main Points. If you are writing an Opinion article, your Main Points are most likely going to be sentences and statements. If you are writing an Actionable Guide, your Main Points are going to be either sentences or categories. And if you are writing a Curated List, your Main Points are going to be the things you are listing: habits, lessons, movies, book titles, etc.

**For example, here are the Main Points of my Opinion article**, “Smart People Aren’t Born Smart. They Do This, And Become Smart As A Result.” 
1. Smart People Read (a lot). 
2. Smart people hang around other smart people. 
3. Smart people love making mistakes. 
4. Smart people see value in all types of knowledge. 
5. Smart people work (very, very) hard.

When I started writing this article, the first thing I did was write down these five Main Points. I wanted to have a sense of direction for the piece, and more importantly, to know how much space I needed to allocate for each point. As a rule of thumb, the more Main Points you have, the less explanation you are going to have for each one (in order to stay within the sweet spot of 800 to 1,200 words). Conversely, the less Main Points you have, the more explanation you are going to need in order for each point to stand securely on its own. 

Let me repeat again: 
• More Main Points = Less Explanation 
• Less Main Points = More Explanation

Once you have the skeleton of your piece outlined, and you have a sense of how “big” (visually) each Main Point is going to be, the next step is to start filling them in.

#### 1/2/5/3/1 

For articles that have three or less Main Points, you are going to want to use a structure that doesn’t cut your explanations too short. 

The 1/2/5/3/1 structure is a good framework to use when thinking about how to make a solid argument for whatever it is you’re writing about, without getting “lost in the sauce” and rambling on and on.

**Here’s how it works: **

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. 
>
This fourth sentence starts to expand on the point. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort of credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence builds on that story or insight and tells the reader something they maybe didn’t know. This seventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this eighth sentence is why that conclusion matters. 
>
This ninth sentence recaps what you just told the reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the argument you’re making with an additional tidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence drives the point home.
>
This twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the important takeaway.

Looking at the above, you can then imagine what this entire piece would look like if each of your Main Points followed this same structure. Each section opens with a clear, declarative sentence. Each section ends with a clear declarative sentence. And the “bulk” of each section exists in the middle, where a reader doesn’t feel like they’re slogging through one long, dense paragraph after another. 

All of a sudden, whatever you’re writing about feels ultra-actionable. You know exactly how many Main Points you want to cover. You know exactly how much explaining you should do within each section. And if you want the piece to be longer than 800 to 1,200 words, all you have to do is keep adding Main Points, copy/pasting the same structure within them.

#### 1/3/1 (+ 1/3/1) 

Now, let’s say you’re writing about a topic with more than three points. 

Having more Main Points does not mean making the piece longer. Your writing, no matter what genre you’re in, should not be longer for longer sake—ever. If anything, you want to always be thinking the opposite for online writing. You should be asking yourself, “How can I make this shorter? How can I make this faster? How can I require less of the reader’s time?” 

Speed is how you win on the internet. 

As I mentioned above, the more Main Points you have in a piece, the less explanation you should give each point. This is where a structure like 1/3/1 works extremely well— because it forces you, the writer, to make serious choices about what’s worth saying and what’s not.

**Here’s how it works:** 

>This first sentence is your opener. 
>
This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. This fourth sentence is your mini conclusion. 
>
This fifth sentence is why that mini conclusion matters specifically to your target reader.

You can tell there is this massive leap that happens between the third and fourth sentences. Most writers here would continue describing or explaining whatever it is they’re talking about. Instead, I encourage you to do the opposite. Skip right to the end. Tell the reader why this one specific Main Point matters to them, or what their takeaway should be, and be done. Move on to the next point.

**For example, here’s the fast-paced 1/3/1 structure executed in my article**, “12 Little Things That Show People You’re Intelligent—Without You Having To Say It.”

>**1. Showing up on time.**
>
The most simple indicator of all. 
>
If you are late, you are disrespectful. It doesn’t matter the circumstance — unless the other party is luckily in the same boat (both of you enduring the same traffic). But still, it’s always 210 Chapter 8 best to be the one on time. 
>
>Rule of thumb: if you’re not early, you’re late.

On its own, this paragraph might feel like it’s lacking “depth.” But what you have to remember is that for pieces that have five or more Main Points, the whole reason why a reader is there is because they want to know the Main Points themselves—not necessarily a dissertation on each one. In the above article, I have 12 Main Points. If I had explained each one in depth, chances are, readers would have opened the piece, started scrolling, and then said to themselves, “Jesus this is long,” and then gone back to whatever it was they were doing before (probably watching cat videos). 

So instead, I optimized the piece for the Main Points themselves. A reader could skim just the 12 bolded subheads of the piece and still extract “the Main Points.” 

Which is what happened. 

That article went viral on Medium and accumulated over 250,000 views in less than 7 days.

#### 1/1/1+ 

Now, let’s say you want to move the reader along even faster. 

Nothing moves a reader along better than a single sentence. 

Nothing. 

This structure is a popular one on the internet, however it’s also an easy one to abuse. A lot of writers who discover the power of this structure use it exclusively—and their writing ends up feeling over-caffeinated and loudly monotone. Great writing, no matter how fast or slow, benefits from dynamics. You want to be staccato, and then you want to be legato. You want to crescendo, and then decrescendo. 

Too much of any one rhythm is boring. 

The 1/1/1+ structure is a mechanism you should use for very specific sections within your writing—specifically beginnings and endings of sections. Single sentences are great for calling out individual ideas, statements, or descriptions, and doing so several times in a row can elicit a powerful response in a reader.

**Here’s how it works:** 

>This first sentence is a strong statement. 
>
This second sentence builds on, reinforces, or repeats that strong statement. 
>
This third sentence builds on, reinforces, or repeats that strong statement.

**For example, I use this structure to emphasize a length of time in my article**, “The 1 Thing I Did That Changed My Entire Life For The Better.” 

>Step 2: Like I said, I did this for 2 years. 
>
Two. Years. 
>
Not 3 days.
>
>Not a few weeks. 
>
Two entire years. I started to see how the people I was surrounding myself with weren’t very conducive to who and what I wanted to become. I started to realize I was terrific at coming up with ideas but horrible at seeing them through to completion. I started to understand why I struggled to make friends, and how closed off I was from the world.

If you notice, immediately following the 1/1/1/1 structure, I went into a lengthier paragraph. This was deliberate. When you use the 1/1/1+ structure, you are building momentum. You are moving a reader quickly from Point A to Point B. But after a few big steps, the reader is not going to want to run anymore. They’re going to want to take a quick break and settle into the thing you’re talking about. So, crescendo with the 1/1/1+ rhythm, and then decrescendo with a three, four, or even five-sentence paragraph. 

Then repeat.

#### Main Point / 1, 2, or 3
Finally, let’s say you are writing a piece with twenty Main Points. 

Again, unless you are intentionally trying to write a massive Ultimate Guide that requires twenty Main Points and in-depth explanation for all of them, you are going to want to optimize your writing for readers who are there to skim. That said, I can’t stress enough how important it is for the writing beneath each Main Point to still hold value. Just because you only have two sentences to make a point, doesn’t mean those two sentences are worthless. If anything, you should be asking how you can make those two sentences as impactful as possible—with the understanding that some readers are only going to read your bolded Main Points.

**Here’s how it works:** 

>**You have your Main Point here.** 
>
And then you have one, two, or three sentences (max) expanding on that Main Point.

That’s it. 

Because you have to think: if you are aiming to write a 1,000 word article, and you have twenty Main Points, that means each point can only have 50 words—and that’s not counting your introduction, or any sort of conclusion. Which is why I encourage you to skeleton your pieces and list out your Main Points before you begin. 

**For example, I use this structure in my article**, “20 Things Nobody Tells You About Growing Up.”

>**1. Most people are scared of imagination They’ve disconnected with their inner child.** 
>
>They don’t feel they are “creative.” They like things “just the way they are.” 
>
>**2. Your dream doesn’t really matter to anyone else.** 
>
>Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you. 
>
>**3. Friends are relative to where you are in your life.** 
>
>Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends.

In articles like these, it’s the Main Points that are the most valuable parts of the entire piece. 

Remember, the reason why a reader chose to click on this headline was because they cared about the “20 Things.” So, I spent a significant amount of time refining each Main Point to be highly relevant to the reader and topic at hand. If my Main Points had been broad, vague words instead, I guarantee this article wouldn’t have performed as well as it did (300,000 views across Inc Magazine, Quora, and Medium). 

Take a look: 
>**1. Imagination** 
>
They’ve disconnected with their inner child. They don’t feel they are “creative.” They like things “just the way they are.” 
>
**2. Dream**
>
Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you.
>
**3. Friends** 
>
Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends.

A style like this (where the subheads are just individual words) is actually much harder for a reader to skim. 

The reason is because the Main Points don’t really give “the answer” they came looking for (“What are the 20 Things?”). Instead, they’re forced to take an extra step and actually read each point in detail. And I can hear a lot of crusty old writers shouting, “Yes! God forbid a reader actually reads the damn thing!” But as the young whippersnapper in the room here, I have to be the bearer of bad news and point out: how you get readers online to actually read what you wrote in the first place is by hooking their attention. 

Otherwise, they aren’t even going to get past your first Main Point.

#### Bolded Statements 

Now, let’s say you aren’t writing something that is a numbered list. 

All of these same mechanics, structures, and rhythms still apply. Instead of thinking of your Main Points in terms of a list, think of them in terms of individual statements. What’s the next “new” piece of information you can reveal to the reader? And how can you emphasize certain statements, insights, or stories to drive home the purpose of the piece?

Writers severely underestimate how powerful subheads are in the world of online writing. If you don’t use subheads, you’re at a disadvantage simply because readers on the internet specifically look for bolded, highlighted, emphasized pieces of the story. Why? Because these feel like shortcuts. They’re candy. A bolded sentence subconsciously tells a reader, “I’m not going to waste your time. Something important is happening here.” 

When executed perfectly, the same way a reader could skim all the Main Points of an article and feel like they “got it,” a reader should be able to skim all the bolded subheads and sentences within a piece and feel like they “got it.”

**For example, here’s an introduction that uses subheads to push a reader along quickly**, in my article, “How I Spend My Free Time Is Why I Am Successful.”

>**Invest in yourself.** 
>
The other day, I was chatting with a friend of a friend, a senior in high school who was getting ready to go off to college. 
>
“I want to start my life over,” he said. “I want to reinvent myself, and prove that you don’t have to follow the same path as everyone else.” 
>
“You can do that,” I said. “But you have to be willing to do 1 thing that not very many teenagers and young adults are willing to do.”
>
“What’s that?” he asked.
>
You have to spend more time learning outside of class, than you do in class.
>
This goes for anyone in school, out of school, young, old, whatever. You’re either in class, or you’re at work. 
>
During those hours, you can learn. You can grow. You can improve certain skills. You can even make money.
>
But anyone who truly makes something of themselves sees that time as their daily standard. But they do not see it as “the end.” They do not get out of class, or leave work and think, “Ah, time to sit back, relax, and just chill.”
>
No. They take that “free time” and they reinvest it in themselves. 
>
They work on a side project.
>
They practice their craft. 
>
They improve their skills, or study, or spend time learning from people far more knowledgeable.

Had I not bolded these sentences, this piece would have been read completely differently. In fact, it’s the way these sentences are separated out and highlighted that gives them so much power. Had I just buried them within a paragraph, they would have lost a lot of their weight.

**Take a look:** 

> The other day, I was chatting with a friend of a friend, a senior in high school who was getting ready to go off to college. “I want to start my life over,” he said. “I want to reinvent myself, and prove that you don’t have to follow the same path as everyone else.”

During those hours, you can learn. You can grow. You can improve certain skills. You can even make money. But anyone who truly makes something of themselves sees that time as their daily standard. But they do not see it as “the end.” They do not get out of class, or leave work and think, “Ah, time to sit back, relax, and just chill.”

The content is exactly the same, but because it’s structured differently, you read it differently. 

Which is why there is so much power in understanding the visual nature of online writing, and how you can use these signals to your advantage—to hook and keep a reader’s attention. 

Once you understand the basics of creating a skeleton of your Main Points, and expanding or contracting the amount of explanation for each, you can then start to make up your own structures and rhythms. 

Here are a few more that I use often.

#### Short / Long / Long / Short 

Thinking of structure in terms of sentence length is only the beginning. You have a lot more room to play in if you think of total paragraph length instead. 

**For example, here’s an excerpt from my article**, “Disciplined People Who Achieve Their Goals Live By These 7 Habits.

>Anyone can make a list of goals—but only a few learn how to be disciplined enough to achieve them. 
>
I grew up in a home and a family that constantly reinforced the importance of self-discipline. Every single night, I’d watch my dad set the timer on the coffee maker and put his oatmeal in the refrigerator for the next morning. By 5:30 a.m., he’d be awake. By 6:00 a.m., he’d be in the gym. By 7:00 a.m., he’d be knocking on my bedroom door, making sure I was awake. And by 8:00 a.m., he’d be at the hospital ready to operate. My dad is a spine surgeon. 
>
My mom, meanwhile, somehow managed to work as a voice teacher at a local college, and take my sister to her violin lessons, and take my younger brother to gymnastics practice, and take my other younger brother to chess club, all while making sure dinner was on the table by 5:00 p.m., and everyone was working on their homework or practicing their respective musical instrument by 7:00 p.m.
>
Our house operated like a retreat for the arts with my mother’s thumb on a stopwatch.

Paragraphs two and three in this excerpt are nearly the same size—and yet the second paragraph is six sentences and paragraph three is one very long sentence. 

There are a few things to take note of here.

**First**, you never want to have three or more long paragraphs one after another. That style of writing has been dead for years, and anyone writing that way on the internet is clinging to a way things were but no longer are. 

**Second**, if you are going to have long paragraphs one after another, you want to find ways to change up their internal rhythm so they don’t feel or sound exactly the same. One way of doing this is by using punctuation. Have one paragraph with a lot of short, strong sentences. Have the next paragraph be one long, winding sentence. 

This is what makes them seem “different.” 

**Lastly**, notice how before and after both long paragraphs in the above excerpt there are single, declarative sentences. This is very intentional. Again, you want to subtly tell the reader, “I’m going to tell you a quick story—this will only take a second,” before giving them their next mile marker. There’s something about reading a single sentence after a long paragraph that gives a reader the same feeling a listener gets hearing a chord resolve on the piano. 

Let your chords resolve.

#### Repetition

Repetition is a common mechanism in poetry. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be used in other forms of writing.

One of the best ways to avoid spending unnecessary time explaining things to a reader is to use repetition as a way of advancing your Rate of Revelation. Think of repetition as a bulleted list, but in prose form. 

**For example, here’s an excerpt from my article**, “How Do Some People Succeed So Quickly? They Approach Life Like This.” 

>**1. Every single moment, of every single day, you are “practicing” something.** 
>
If you don’t floss in the morning, you’re practicing not-flossing.
>
If you choose to eat quinoa and veggies instead of Frosted Flakes, you’re practicing eating for fuel instead of eating for enjoyment.
>
If you yell at your significant other, you’re practicing a lack of self-control. 
>
If you watch TV instead of working on your book, you’re practicing postponing your dream of becoming a novelist. 
>
The moment you start to see the world this way, you start to realize that every single moment, of every single day, you are practicing something.
>
And how aware you are of whatever it is you’re practicing dictates how consciously (or unconsciously) you move toward or away from where it is you actually want to be: whether that’s a destination, a physical place, or an emotional state.

Here, I am combining the 1/1/1/1 structure with repetition to give a reader plenty of actionable examples without forcing them to read through paragraphs of prose. I’m only giving them what they absolutely need—and then once I’ve given them a handful of examples, I follow up with a longer, more descriptive paragraph (alternating rhythms).

#### First, Second, etc...

There’s a subtle difference in voice between an article that “lists” two points, compared to one that emphasizes point one, and then point two. On the one hand, will numbering vs “saying” your points make or break the performance of your piece? Probably not. But these small details are the types of things you should be constantly questioning in your writing—so that you can deploy the most effective mechanisms for each and every moment.

**For example, here’s an excerpt from my article**, “You Stop Being Productive The Moment You Do This.”

>Contrary to popular belief, there is such a thing as being “too productive.” 
>
I like to think about this in two ways: 
>
**First, you are being “too productive” the moment that your input becomes disproportionate to your output.**
>
Let’s use writing as an example. I know a good many writers who feel all sorts of productive simply because of how many books they’re able to read in a day, week, month, or year. 
>
Now, let’s say you are an incredibly productive reader. You are able to read pages and pages without effort. You are able to retain a significant amount of the material you consume. When it comes to reading, you are an absolute professional. 
>
The problem is, your “Chief Aim,” your GOAL, isn’t to become a master reader (maybe that’s a tangential goal, but it’s not your main goal). Your goal is to become a writer. And while reading is certainly an important part of writing, and become a professional writer, the moment your input becomes disproportionate to your output, you are no longer being productive. Because while you may be turning into an incredibly effective reader, there is a tipping point where “more reading” isn’t going to move you any further along as a writer. 
>
So, the “act” can be productive, but unless the “act” is aligned with the GOAL, then it wouldn’t be accurate to say your ACTIONS (as a whole) are productive.
>
That’s the first example.
>
**The second example of being “too productive” is when your productivity has a disproportionate impact on your quality of life.**
>
In order to achieve anything great in life, you will have to make sacrifices. 
>
It would be naive to think that you could achieve the highest levels of success (or “productivity”) without some compromise: letting go of certain relationships, eating less healthfully, sleeping less, enduring high amounts of stress, etc. Whatever that compromise becomes is up to you, but somewhere, somehow, your drive toward your “Chief Aim” will cause you to have to ignore other aspects of your life. 
>
However, there’s a tipping point here as well. 
>
The moment your drive puts you in the hospital, you know you have a problem. The moment your significant other sits you down and says, “I can’t keep seeing you like this,” you know you’ve gone too far. The variables of life can bend, but at a certain point, they can and they will snap. And it’s up to you to figure out how far you can bend before you break.

By crafting each Main Point as a statement, instead of just a two-point list, the piece feels like you’re speaking directly to the reader. They can hear the emphasis in the voice. They can feel the power of what’s being said, and understand why these two (specific) Main Points are delivering on the PROMISE made in the headline.

There’s also an element of repetition here, writing out “first” and “second” in the subheads. There was also repetition in the very first example I used, each subhead stating, “Smart People X, Smart People Y, Smart People Z.” There’s something about repetition in subheads that tells the reader, “This piece was very intentionally organized,” again reinforcing that you are credible, that you know what you’re doing, and that you’re the right person they should be reading on this particular topic.

#### Bold ½ Sentences 

This is one of my favorite, and yet one of the least used mechanisms in online writing. 

Combine repetition with bolding the first half of your sentences. 

The whole idea here is to do nothing but emphasize the structure you’re using to your readers. So much of online writing is about signaling—signaling this piece is easy to read, signaling you know what you’re doing, signaling it’s fun and there’s a voice and rhythm here worth paying attention to (see how even in this sentence, I’ve repeated the word “signaling” multiple times?).

**For example, here’s an excerpt from my article**, “This 1 Tip Changed My Writing Forever.”

>A few months after that, he’d quit the game and I was one of the highest-ranked players in the entire country. 
>
That lesson is, to date, one of the most influential pieces of advice I’ve ever received as a human being. That was the first time someone I looked up to, someone I wanted to “be like,” told me that no amount of me watching or idolizing someone else was going to replace the hard work I needed to put in myself.
>
**When I started my gaming blog as a teenager**, I implemented that same mentality. I didn’t really read anyone else’s blog. I didn’t “consume.” I just wrote. And wrote. And wrote. Every single night before bed, I pushed myself to write 1 new blog post for the following morning. And by the time I showed up for my first journalism class, Freshman year of college, I had 10,000 gamers reading my blog every single day — an unheard of accomplishment in 2009, back when blogging was considered “weird.”
>
**When I quit gaming and started bodybuilding**, I applied this same mentality again. I didn’t spend hours and hours watching other people lift online. I went to the gym and lifted myself. And I transformed from a 110 pound, awkward, skinny teenager, to a 170 pound shredded fitness model.
>
**When I stopped bodybuilding and started really nurturing my craft for writing**, I did it again. I wrote 1 answer every single day here on Quora for almost 3 years in a row. I wrote 400+ columns for Inc Magazine. I ghostwrote nearly 1,000 articles for CEOs and founders and investors and public speakers. And every single night, I worked on my first book, Confessions of a Teenage Gamer. I didn’t sit in my room and consume other people’s writing for hours and hours. I practiced my writing instead.

In this story, each one of these paragraphs is covering a different period of time.

If I had crammed them all together, the reader would have felt overwhelmed, and maybe even lost. They’d be saying to themselves, “Wait, what do gaming and bodybuilding and writing have to do with each other? Why are you jumping around so much?” 

To combat that confusion, I chose to separate each “chapter,” and then bold the first half of the sentence to signal to the reader, “In this paragraph we’re talking about gaming. In this paragraph we’re talking about bodybuilding. And in this paragraph we’re talking about writing.” All of a sudden, this small tweak makes the reader feel like they have a firm sense of what they’re reading and how it’s being organized.

The key, however, is to tie the bolded sentence to one paragraph and one paragraph only. 

### Conclusions

Conclusions are tricky. 

In stories, particularly fiction but also nonfiction as well, the conclusion of the story is known as the “descending action.” The climax has already happened—the wall was torn down, the war was officially won (or lost), the main character’s love interest died, etc.—and now the reader needs to know how things ended up. What was the result of this story’s climax? 

Inherently, any descending action is going to be less interesting than the ascending action that came before it. There’s momentum, anticipation, and suspense in ascending action. Descending action is more about reflection and meaningful takeaways. And these can still be interesting story elements to the reader, but there’s a reason why the ascending action was 200 pages and the descending action was the last 30 pages of the book. 

Once the climax happens, the reader is “done.”

#### When it comes to online writing, conclusions are optional. 

The truth is, readers don’t need them. 

Especially in an 800 to 1,200-word article, a conclusion should happen in the span of a paragraph—or even a single sentence. Your last Main Point is technically the “climax” of the piece. And if we know anything about digital readers, it’s that as soon as they’re “done,” they’re done. They’ve already swiped back to their feed and started looking for the next piece of content to give their time and attention. 

There are a handful of rhythms you can use to craft effective conclusions.

#### The Cliff

One of the best ways to get a reader to read another piece of your writing is to leave them with a massive cliffhanger. 

This type of structure works extremely well with Curated Lists, where the entire purpose of the piece is for you to list Main Points that speak to the reader’s interests. In these types of pieces, the reader doesn’t need a big, fancy conclusion. They got what they came for and they’re happy you delivered on that PROMISE. 

So, as soon as you finish your last Main Point, jump off the cliff. 

Don’t even say goodbye.

**For example, here’s the last Main Point from my article**, “30 Things You Should Know About Life Before You Turn 30.”

>**30. Ten years is a very long time.** 
>
When I was 19, 20 years old, I wanted to be a rapper. 
>
When I was 21, 22, 23, I wanted to be a bodybuilder.
>
When I was 24, 25, 26, I wanted to be a creative director at a huge advertising agency.
>
When I was 27, 28, 29, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. 
>
And from age 17 to 29, I’ve wanted to be a writer. 
>
In my 20s, I got to live 4 completely different lives. I immersed myself in 4 different industries, learned entire tool kits of different skills, made different friends, explored different paths, and ultimately became different versions of myself. 
>
And every one of those pursuits made me who I am “today.” 
>
If I was able to live that many different lives in those ten years, then I can only imagine what 30 to 40 will look like, and how many different lives I may be able to live again. 
>
Ten years is a long time. And the older you get, the more knowledge you accumulate, the more resources you have, and the more freedom in front of you to become whatever it is you want to become. 
>
I don’t feel old at 30.
>
I feel like I’m just getting started.

Here, I deliberately wrote the last Main Point of the piece to stick within the structure of all the other Main Points, but also “sound” like a conclusion. There’s no all encompassing takeaway. There’s no whole other section explaining to the reader why what they just read matters. My PROMISE was, “30 Things You Should Know About Life Before You Turn 30.” I delivered on that PROMISE. And now we’re done.

However, even if your last Main Point doesn’t have a nuanced conclusion, this technique can still work well.

**For example, here’s how I end my article**, “Successful People Tell Themselves These 7 Things On A Daily Basis.

>7. “Never forget why you started.” 
>
Again, I am constantly surprised by people who have achieved massive amounts of success in their lives, and how connected they are to the beginning of their journey. 
>
They remember where they started. They remind themselves often why they got into the business they’re in. Their motivation comes from a love for growth, not necessarily the achievement of an end goal.
>
In order to maintain long-term success, this is a crucial part of the process. You have to remember why you started down this road in the first place — and do everything in your power to make sure you never forget it.

As a reader, if you finished reading this article and felt yourself wanting more, you would need to click to read another one of my articles. 

That’s the whole point of The Cliff.

#### The Extended Final Main Point 

Another way you can end a piece is by baking your mini conclusion into the very last Main Point. 

Instead of starting a whole new section, just extend your final thoughts with an extra paragraph or sentence. Elaborate not just on the Main Point you were making, but on the meaningful takeaways from all your Main Points in the piece. 

**For example, I use the Extended Final Main Point structure in this article**, “7 Questions You Should Ask Yourself To Become A Better Person.”

>**7. “How can I be more helpful — to those around me, and to myself?”** 
>
It’s taken me a long time to learn that if you can’t spend all your time trying to make everyone around you happy. 
>
You have to prioritize keeping yourself happy too. Which is why it’s worth questioning both, simul taneously. 
>
What can you do to be more helpful to those around you? How can you be more encouraging, more patient? And at the same time, how can you do those same things toward yourself? 
>
Personal development is an ongoing practice. It’s not a destination. It’s not something you do once and then you’re a “perfect person” for the rest of your life. 
>
Personal development is your ability to continuously ask yourself these questions on a daily basis, and slowly improve over time. 
>
Like water over rocks, who you are is sculpted over years and years.

If you read closely, the final Main Point ends and the conclusion begins with the sentence, “Personal development is an ongoing practice.” 

As a reader, there’s no clear indicator they’ve exited the last Main Point and suddenly entered the conclusion—which is good. The reader then gets the benefit of feeling like the piece has a nice neat bow on top, without needing to slog through a whole other section repeating everything that came before it (which most readers will just skim through anyway).

#### The Summary 

The Summary technique works particularly well within Actionable Guide articles, or very long pieces with lots of different sections.

Readers appreciate summaries. There’s a reason why nearly every self-help or business book ends each chapter with a “recap” or page of “action steps.” Especially when you’re covering a lot of ground, or a topic requires a lot of additional explanation, summaries are a way for you to make sure you and the reader are on the same page (pun intended) before moving on to the next Main Point.

**For example, I use a bulleted summary as the conclusion at the very end of my article**, “You Stop Being Productive The Moment You Start Doing This.” 

> **The art of “being productive,” then, is all about balancing the following variables:**
> 
• Input as it relates to output (you should be “doing” more than you’re “consuming”) 
> 
• Productivity weighed against the sustainable aspects of your life (mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health) 
> 
• Driving the highest impact for the lowest amount of effort (prioritizing what’s truly going to “move the needle” over what doesn’t move the needle but feels urgent)
>
Finding this sweet spot is the reason why some people do incredible things with our universal 24-hour clock, and others do almost nothing.

Instead of re-stating everything I just said, I recapped the Main Points in a bulleted list to make the reader feel like they had the Sparknotes version—with one single sentence at the very end as an all-encompassing conclusion. You can also imagine how you could use this technique at the end of an introduction, or even at the end of any of your Main Points to help the reader follow along more closely. 

Readers love checklists, action steps, quick recaps, small reminders, etc., so the more you can use these techniques to your advantage, the easier it will be for them to understand precisely what it is you’re trying to tell them.

#### Strong Opinion 

If you’re going to take the time to end a piece with some sort of complete conclusion, I encourage you to make it a Strong Opinion. 

There’s nothing more boring to a reader than writing that just re-says what it just said. A great conclusion is one that drives home a new point, or makes it very clear why someone should or shouldn’t do something. Actionable advice, or an unexpected insight, are things that make the reader feel like the conclusion is almost another Main Point, just speaking a bit more holistically. 

**For example, this is the conclusion in my Opinion article**, “Why Gary Vaynerchuk’s Perspective On Meditation Is Everything That’s Wrong With Mindfulness In Entrepreneurship.”

>**Stop trying to ‘unlock’ yourself for the sake of achievement.** 
>
As Vaynerchuk says often, “I don’t know what will happen once I buy the Jets. I don’t actually want to buy the Jets. I’m in love with the hustle. The Game.” And what happens when that game stops? When you can no longer escape into the endlessly fun pursuit of mastering the rules, overcoming obstacles, and proving yourself among your competitors? What happens when you’ve bought the new “meditation drink” and you’re bored of wearing your “meditation clothes” and you’ve eaten at all the nearby “meditation-friendly food spots.” 
>
The dust will settle. You will find yourself in silence. 
>
And in that uncomfortable moment, with nothing else to achieve, you will be left with only yourself. 
>
THAT, is the purpose of meditation. And I encourage every — not just entrepreneur, but human being — to make time for that practice.

What makes this an effective conclusion is that the advice, “Stop trying to ‘unlock’ yourself for the sake of achievement” could be a Main Point in itself.

This is why I’m such a big believer in The Cliff as a writing mechanism for the internet. Everything you write should, in some sense, feel like both a stand-alone piece and a piece within your larger library. You want readers to want more from you. You want them to feel like you cut them off right when momentum was high. You want them clicking to read more and more and more of your stuff— without them feeling tricked or dragged along.

Lazy writers do this by saying things like, “Which is why, if you want to know more, you should check out my website, and if you want to hear what I really think about this topic, you should check out my YouTube,” blah blah blah. 

Readers hate that shit. 

Instead, just say what you want to say in this one individual piece, and be done. Let there be some dissonance in the air. Let readers feel like you could have said more, but didn’t. 

This is what gets them to come back again and again.
