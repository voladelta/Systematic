## 8 STEPS IN THE STORY CIRCLE
1. You — A character is in a zone of comfort,
2. Need — But they want something.
3. Go — They enter an unfamiliar situation,
4. Search — Adapt to it,
5. Find — Get what they wanted, 
6. Take — Pay a heavy price for it, 
7. Return — Then return to their familiar situation, 
8. Change — Having changed.

## Step One: You
The essence of the "You" step is to establish the protagonist of the story. It doesn't always need to be a single person. It could be a family or a team. This is our introduction to our main character(s), an opportunity to see them before the story truly begins. 

This is important in creating a compelling character arc. A huge part of storytelling is the "change" the protagonist makes during their journey. In this stage, we firmly establish their starting point so we can assess this change at the end. This is also the time to understand the context around the character — their world, its rules, and how they fit inside it.

If we look at our case studies, we can see what the "You" step looks like.
- Toy Story — We meet Woody and see the joy he receives from being Andy's favorite toy.
- Inception — We meet Cobb and are introduced to his work as a contractor stealing information from people's subconscious.
- Star Wars — We meet Luke, stuck working on his uncle's farm, yearning to explore the outside world.

## Step Two: Need 
Once we've been introduced to the protagonist and their world, the next step is to figure out what they "need." Something happens to our character that presents a problem or a question. This is when the story starts to take shape — if "You" is the who of the story, "Need" is the what. 

This is where we learn the main goal of the protagonist, the pursuit of which will guide the rest of the story.
- Toy Story — With the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, Woody needs to figure out how to once again become Andy's favorite.
- Inception — Cobb needs to decide whether to take Saito's assignment, which could allow him to return home to his kids.
- Star Wars — As R2-D2 delivers Princess Leia's message, Obi-wan invites Luke to join him in delivering the Death Star plans.

## Step Three: Go
Needs drive us into action. The "Go" step marks the protagonist's first steps across the threshold in pursuit of the need. This is why you always hear "we need an active protagonist." If there is a "Need" but not a "Go," the story ends. When writing your own script, make your need so vital that it's impossible not to go.

Crossing this 3rd step is also when the protagonist enters the bottom half of the Story Circle. Leaving their normal world behind and officially entering the unknown.
- Toy Story — After Woody knocks Buzz out through the window, the rest of the toys turn on him. Andy takes Woody to Pizza Planet.
- Inception — Cobb sets out to assemble his team for Saito's assignment, including a new architect, forger and chemist.
- Star Wars — When Luke returns home to find his aunt and uncle murdered, he leaves with Obi-wan on their quest to Alderaan.

## Step Four: Search
Search is where things begin getting more complicated. Both concerning the story you are telling AND in terms of the process. The character can address the need by searching for an answer. Great stories don't always do this so literally. For Harmon's Story Circle, it works to keep it active and straightforward. 

In a big epic feature film drama or a novel, the "search" is going to require more than a physical search. That means it's a series of obstacles the hero must overcome. It's where the rubber meets the road regarding that need.
- Toy Story — Woody finds Buzz but they get trapped at Sid's house where they endure imminent destruction.
- Inception — Cobb's team is ambushed, Saito is shot, they have no choice but to proceed with the plan.
- Star Wars — Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star while the Millenium Falcon gets caught in its tractor beam.

## Step Five: Find
Eureka! The hero has searched and searched, and now he's found the Need that sent them on this journey. But is the story over? Nope. Because in a good story, the hero doesn't find what he needs.

He might have found what he wanted, but it turns out he needs something else. Something bigger. This is where plot and character development often collide.
- Toy Story — Woody plans their escape from Sid's house and bonds with Buzz over why it's so great to be a toy.
- Inception — Cobb enlists his target, Fischer, to help break into his own subconscious but Robert is killed and sent to limbo.
- Star Wars — While planning their escape from the Death Star, Luke and Han rescue Princess Leia from the detention block.

## Step Six: Take
Take whatever you found! And escape with it! Campbell might call this part of the story circle the magic flight. Even though the hero successfully acquires their Need, it comes at a price. Even after their initial success, the protagonist(s) suffer heavily losses.

Depending on the genre, these "losses" could be anything from a temporary setback to the death of a major character.
- Toy Story — As Woody and Buzz attempt to make it back to the moving truck, RC's battery dies, leaving them stranded.
- Inception — Cobb and Ariadne risk entering limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, Cobb finally lets go of his guilt over Mal's death.
- Star Wars — During their escape from the Death Star, Obi-wan sacrifices himself so that they can get away.

## Step Seven: Return
The return stage is coming into the home stretch. The character has brought back into the normal realm whatever they found and took. Be it a magical item, a person, a lesson...and as a result of this they...change.
- Toy Story — Woody and Buzz make return safely to Andy.
- Inception — Cobb emerges from limbo with Saito and awake on the plane, their mission a success.
- Star Wars — The Rebels launch an attack on the Death Star and Luke is able to destroy it.

## Step Eight: Change
The change could be a personal one; it can be change to the world around them. In the instance of a movie or long story, it would be both.

Sometimes the change has opposite effects too. The world has changed for the better, but maybe the protagonist has changed for the worst. Playing with the change step can be interesting. 
- Toy Story — Woody learns to co-exist with Buzz.
- Inception — Cobb returns to his children having let go of his guilt.
- Star Wars — Luke has evolved from farm boy to Rebel pilot.

## Closing up the Story Circle
Change is what makes it a good story. Change is the key to any story. The 8 steps built into the Story Circle are designed to facilitate that change.

What do we do when we tell stories? In a basic, primal way, we try to grasp the changes around us. The changes that we can't control. Why do people die? Why does the sun rise each day? 

Our stories are how we better understand the world around us. In a way, stories are how we help ourselves cope with change. Reminding ourselves over and again that change will happen, and life goes on.

## Example - The Dark Night
1. “YOU”
This is the undisturbed status quo of the protagonist. This leads to the “Point of Attack.”
> E.g. In The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne dresses up in a special suit, calls himself Batman, and brings the pain to Gotham's bad guys.

2. “NEED”
This is the “Creation of the story.” This leads to “Defining The Main Tension”

> E.g. Bruce Wayne is getting a little old for this… He’s eyeing retiring “Batman”  so he can be with the love of his life, Rachel. But who will protect Gotham? Maybe… Harvey Dent?

3. “GO”
Elaborate on why accomplishing the goal will be difficult. 

> E.g. To put his plan in motion, Batman must help Harvey Dent by bringing the criminal, Lao, to justice.

4. “SEARCH”
First attempt to resolve the main tension, the road of trials. This leads to the midpoint, “FIND.” This refines the main tension, narrows its scope, and makes it more specific.

> E.g. Just when Bruce thinks he can celebrate his retirement, The Joker takes the stage and unleashes a new wave of crime upon Gotham.

5. “FIND”
This is when your protagonist finds what they think they need, but it doesn’t work out quite the way they expected. Your protagonist must pay a devastating price for attaining what they sought.

> E.g. This is when the protagonist FINDS what they were looking for. Bruce finds how to stop the Joker and save Gotham: unmask himself. But Harvey does it first… 

6. “TAKE”
Full frontal assault on main tension. This leads to the main tension being resolved “yes or no” … For now…

> E.g. Batman finally TAKES the Joker in, and has him in his clutches, but the Joker springs a trap. It costs Rachel her life, and Bruce his future.

7. “RETURN”
False resolution or exposition sequence. This leads to the twist! We’ve been set-up to expect one thing, then it turns around. 

> E.g. The protagonist returns, but changed. For Bruce, the need to retire Batman was lost with Rachel. Now he must protect Gotham. The Joker has turned Harvey, making Batman’s final task that much more painful.

8. “CHANGE”
Ultimate resolution (what happens after this character has gone through these circumstances and made these decisions.

> E.g. The change is put to the test. Batman defeats the Joker, but the matter of Two-Face remains. Batman breaks his one rule when he kills Two-Face. To preserve Harvey’s legacy, he takes the blame for Two-Face’s killing spree. He commits to protecting Gotham while being hunted and reviled. In doing so, he CHANGES into... The Dark Knight.
