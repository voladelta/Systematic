How do you define product/market fit?

This response probably won’t make me more friends in Silicon Valley, where the idea of “product market fit” has become unquestioned gospel.

In the tech startup world, achieving product market fit is often considered a major milestone in a new company or new product’s life.

And I believe, product market fit is one of the most dangerous ideas in business today.

Why?

Imagine a small remote country, where no one has shoes. Two shoe entrepreneurs hear about this country.

One says, “let’s ignore that country because no one buys shoes there.”

The other says, “WOW, look at the massive potential! An entire country of new opportunity!!!!”

Which entrepreneur would you rather be?

Words matter.

Because language creates thinking and thinking drives action. That makes product market fit, a dangerous use of language.

Because the phrase, tricks entrepreneurs and creators of all kinds into thinking that success is about designing a product that “fits” into an existing market category.

That’s NOT what successful people do. Legendary creators are NOT looking to “fit” in.

They want to STAND OUT.

The most successful people become known for a niche that they own.

Jeff Bezos = eCommerce
Pablo Picasso = Cubism
Sara Blakely = Shapeware

Think about the most respected entrepreneurs, creators and inventors. We admire them because they broke or took new ground.

There was no market for surf wetsuits before Jack O’Neill. He created it. Not just the product, but a whole new market category.

Sara Blakely didn’t try to fit her new product – Spanx — into the girdle category. She said it was a new invention called “shapeware”. Now she’s a billionaire.

There was no market place renting couches and extra bedrooms before AirBnB. They designed the category. Now they do over $2.5B in sales and dominate the market category they created.

AirBnB was not trying to fit into the hotel category.

And had they tried, they would have found no market to fit into.

Before Evian, water was not a luxury item. Evian did not try to fit into the existing consumer water category at the time, because there wasn’t one. Pre-Evian, water was a free thing from a tap. Post-Evain, it’s an expensive thing in a bottle.

Speaking of drinks…. RedBull. They designed the energy drink category and became a massively successful category queen. Ruling over a space they created.

Then RedBull forgot that categories make brands and they launched RebBull Cola. They tried a “we’re better than Coke” strategy. And got crushed.

Microsoft made the same mistake with Bing and Google made it with Google Plus. Categories make brands, not the other way around.

If you have square peg product, it will not fit into a round whole market.

Legends introduce the world to something new, unique and different. The move the world FROM the way it is, TO the way they want it to be.

The greatest innovators teach the world to think differently. With a fresh idea, a new take on an old problem or by solving a problem we didn’t even know we had.

It has been reported that Henry Ford once said, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”

Steve Jobs famously said, “customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.”

There was no market category for hand sanitizers or energy shots before Purell and 5-hour Energy.

See a pattern emerging?

The big ah-ha here is that there is a massive distinction between creating and competing.

People who think the path way to success is about product market fit, play a competition game.

They do marketing to capture demand.

People who believe they have created something different, play a category design game.

They do marketing to create demand.

Category designers introduce the world to a new product, company and category at the same time. And reap the massive personal and professional rewards for doing it.

As a matter of fact, we found that category queens and kings earn 76% of all of the value in a given market space.

PLEASE don’t make this mistake.

Before you go down the product market fit / faster horse path, remember the sage words of Robert Frostwho said,

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I — I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.”

Too many innovations die because they fail to make their place in the world.

Create a game you can win – don’t play someone else’s. Summon the courage to be different and design your own category.

Because it’s the people who are different, who make the biggest difference.
