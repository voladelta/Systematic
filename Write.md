The hero’s journey is universal because, at its most basic, it is always a quest for identity.
 
and and but and therefore : ABT.
 
The beginning exposition lays out an idea or a situation with some ands, the conflict or reaction is introduced with buts and the resulting consequences or change are introduced with therefore (although in common speech, so is much more common and what I generally use).
 
 a simple rule for how you would use ABT in your writing—the “rule of replacing,”
  
 [I call it] the rule of replacing “ands” with either “buts” or “therefores.” And so it’s always like: This happens and then this happens and then this happens. Whenever I can go back in the writing and change that to: This happens, therefore this happens, but this happened; whenever you can replace your “ands” with “buts” or “therefores,” it makes for better writing.
  
 It’s that simple. Take a draft of your writing or speech and replace as many “ands” (or other connecting words, like “or”) as you can with a “but” (or another word of conflict or contradiction, like “yet”) or a “therefore” (or similar words, like “so”).

Repetition and imitation are the twin pillars of going viral — they are literally what going viral means.

Our mind “specializes on analogy and metaphor” for pattern matching.

Pattern matching is most useful when it helps answer this question: How does my current problem or situation resemble another one that I have seen or heard about before? But that’s precisely the job of a metaphor. It connects a known situation to an unknown or novel one.

Gelber credits co-creator Bach as the vital force behind these shorter viral videos, so I talked to the four-time Emmy winner about his secrets. Here are four:
1. “A good opening line of a video can make that video go viral.”
2. “Tell your audience something they didn’t know. But don’t tell them what they should do. Let them see what’s being done.”
3. “What is essential for virality is a video that plays just as well with the sound on as with it off.”
4. “Humor and irony are becoming vital story-telling components if you are going to get your word out on this issue and have a chance of going viral.”


Here is something to remember: DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR INVITES AGGRESSIVE ACTION!

What that means is that in life in general (and in prison in particular) there is very little sympathy for a weakling.

All of us, including thee and me, have a slightly shrewd idea of ourselves. We often try to convince others and ourselves that we are something we are not, something we have an idea we "should" be.

Therefore, truth, my good son, can be determined NOT by how people use their mouth but rather how they use their wallet.

I want to burn this message into your mind. Be skeptical of what people say. Be skeptical of surveys. Of questionnaires. Instead, believe in numbers. For example, if everybody you talk with says they like plays more than movies and yet the numbers say that 10,000 times more people buy movie tickets then you believe the numbers!

If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - guess what? It's probably a duck!

These three guidelines are recency, frequency and unit of sale. A brief explanation follows:
- Recency - The more recently a person has purchased (by mail) something similar to what you are selling, the more receptive he will be to your offer. Get 'em while they're hot! In fact, always check to see if the list you are interested in has "hotline buyers" and see if you can rent them before anybody else. Hotline buyers are the most recent buyers of all. Sometimes they will be 90-day hotline buyers or even 30-day hotline buyers. These names are extremely good prospects!
- Frequency - The more often a person buys a particular item, the higher his desire for that type of production service. It just makes sense. If you are selling a book on skin diving and you can find a list of people who have purchased several other books on skin diving, then you know he is interested in the subject and will be a likely prospect to buy your book.
- Unit of sale - Once again, we have a guideline that just plain makes sense. After all, a person who recently paid $100.00 for a bottle of diet pills is probably a hotter prospect for diet type products than a person who has only paid $10.00 for a bottle of diet pills.

You know, Bondo-Dog, people don't always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are.

Recency, frequency and unit of sale: All good guidelines for evaluation of a mail order list. And, in my opinion, of the three guidelines, RECENCY is, by far, the most important of all.

"What advantage do you want?" they ask.

"The only advantage I want," I reply, "is A STARVING CROWD!"

Think about it.

What I am trying to teach you here is to constantly be on the look out for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service.

We could mail our promotion to a list of wealthy people who have purchased (by mail) a product similar to ours - and who have done so repeatedly - and who have paid big money for what they purchased - AND WHO HAVE VERY RECENTLY MADE SUCH A PURCHASE!
AND WHO OUR FRIENDLY LIST BROKER TELLS US IS WORKING LIKE CRAZY FOR OTHER MAILERS WITH PROMOTIONS SIMILAR TO OURS AND THEY MUST BE SATISFIED CUSTOMERS!

Hire people have enthusiasm

Marketing to people experience emotional milestone/big changes

The only time they are vulnerable is during lifestyle changes.

Graduating college, moving house, changing jobs, marriage or divorce.

And the biggest lifestyle change of all is having a baby.
